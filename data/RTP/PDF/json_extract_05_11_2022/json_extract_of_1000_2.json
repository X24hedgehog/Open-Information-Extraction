Therefore, the sum of spinosyns A and D was recom- mended as the residue definition for compliance with MRLs and for estimation of dietary intake. China\u2019s pesti- cide registration authority has not set the residue definition of spionosad yet, although spinosyns A and D altogether generally constitute more than 90% of the total spinosyns residues. Despite of this lack of residue definition in China, we proposed in this paper that the definition of the residue for an estimation of dietary intake should be the sum of spinosyns A and D. 3.3.

As may be expected, the discriminatory power of the various study types were found to be inversely dependent on the complexity of the study type (Fig. 9). On the other hand, the biologically relevance of the information obtained from such studies increases with complexity of the study type. Sta- tistical analysis of histopathology data for determination of MDDs or minimum differentiable scores is only partially satisfactory because of the nature of these findings. The interpretation of an inhalation study requires consideration of all collected data and evaluation of its biological relevance by an experienced researcher which includes reading across findings, sexes, doses, and maybe from one study (ingredient) to another. For the overall assessment of cigarette ingredients or any other test item, a weight-of-the-evi- dence (consideration of all data) evaluation by experienced researchers balancing the strengths and weaknesses of the various levels of complexity and biological relevance in a tiered battery of complementary test systems is required. 6.

Since intravenously adminis- tered a-CD is not metabolized to any significant extent by the enzymes of the liver or other tissues, the 14C fraction excreted with the urine after oral administration of 14C-a-CD directly reflects the degree of intestinal absorption. In the three experiments with oral admin- istration of 14C-a-CD, not more than about 1% of the administered 14C-a-CD was recovered on average from the urines produced during the first 8 h after dosing (i.e., during the period of small-intestinal transit). All the not digested and not absorbed a-CD, i.e., about 99% of the ingested dose, reaches the microbially colonized seg- ments of the gut where the a-CD ring is readily opened by microbial enzymes (certain amylases and cyclodex- trinase). The resulting linear malto-oligosaccharides are then further hydrolyzed and fermented via well-estab- lished metabolic pathways (Antenucci and Palmer, 1984; Kaewprasert et al., 2001). Overall, the metabolic fate of ingested a-CD resembles, therefore, that of other natu- rally occurring, non-digestible yet fermentable glucans, such as resistant starch.

Therefore, the ADI of diflubenzuron was replaced its ARfD during the HQ calculation. The results of the HQ and RQ assessment of diflubenzuron and di- fenoconazole are shown in Table 5, and the calculation of the RQs are shown in Tables S1\u2013S3 and Tables S4\u2013S6, respectively. Regardless of the sampling interval, all of the values for diflubenzuron were accep- table, with HQs of 3.6\u20138.3% and RQs of 51\u201355%. When the sampling interval was 10 d, the HQ and RQ were 8.3% and 55%, respectively. These results showed there was no significant acute or potential risk to human health from diflubenzuron residue on peaches.

For example, ongoing research on the effects of radiation on Hiroshima and Nagasaki survivors bases its dosimetry estimates on distance from the center of the explosion (see Radiation Effects Research Foundation at http://www.rerf.or.jp/general/research_e/raditiondose.html. lism and elimination are often of negligible relevance, i.e., variabil- ity is not expected in the tissue dose from a chemical that elicits an effect from direct contact. An intra-species factor of 3.16 (100.5), the default value, may then be used for toxicodynamic variability, since variation in responses is expected among individuals given the same tissue dose. However, whether the available data support a reduction of this toxicodynamic default factor to 1-fold, as we suggest, can be argued. For example, the effect of MITC on the lungs of sensitive sub- populations, such as asthmatics, has not been tested, although available data do not indicate their airways are more sensitive than their eyes. For example, out of the approximately 800 incident re- ports on MITC previously summarized, 13 were known to be asth- matics (TERA, 2008). This response of \ufffd2% (13/\ufffd800) is much less than the identified percentage of about 8% for asthmatics in the background population of Kern and Tulare Counties (American Lung Association, ALA, 2008; EPA, 2007a,b), the sites of many inci- dents. Furthermore, as described in TERA (2008), 4 of these 13 asthmatics had symptoms other than eye effects. These symptoms may have indicated either that the eye was not the most sensitive target, or that these symptoms were due to MITC exposures above the level needed to cause eye irritation. The latter explanation seems favored since all 4 asthmatics described symptoms at other organs in addition to the portal of entry. 3.6. Health protective concentrations We determine that the best estimate of a health protective con- centration for a 4-h exposure to MITC is 0.2 ppm. This is found by dividing the average of the BMCL10s of either 0.20 or 0.22 ppm from the lower BMCs for the 4-h trial found in Table 1 by an uncer- tainty factor of 1 for eye irritation, and rounding the result to 1 di- git. The best estimate of a health protective concentration for a 14- min exposure to MITC is 0.8 ppm. This value is determined by dividing the average of the BMCL10s of either 0.83 or 0.78 ppm from the lower BMDs for the 14-min trial found in Table 1 by an uncertainty factor of 1, and rounding the result to 1 digit. The resulting 4-h health protective value of 0.2 ppm is 4-fold lower than that determined by the National Advisory Committee (EPA, 2008b) for its non-disabling Acute Exposure Guideline Level (AEGL-1) of 0.8 ppm. The primary difference between our judg- ments is that we considered sensory eye irritation as the critical ef- fect, whereas the EPA (2008b) considered this as non adverse, and then chose a higher point of departure. Our judgment of a 14-min health protective value of 0.8 ppm is identical to this committee\u2019s 10-min value (EPA, 2008b). In both cases, the Russell and Rush (1996) study formed the basis of the evaluation and an uncertainty factor of 1 was the collective best judgment.

Transparency document", "Compliance with ethical standards": "All these differences in the classification of borderline products at the national level entail complications in the free movement of goods within the EU single market. Moreover, marketing food supplements is a complex issue also for exporters to the EU, such as the United States. A supplement product that is freely available in the United States may not be authorised in the EU. For the categories of dietetic foods, food supplements and fortified foods there were 238 RASFF notifications for products from the United States in the period 2014\u20132016. The most common reason for non-compliance was the presence of unauthorised composition. This might be a result of the absence of full EU-harmo- nisation of the rules covering food supplements and thus a large number of different national rules need to be faced (GAIN Report, 2017). It should be noticed that unscrupulous manufacturers and distributors are focused on taking advantage of such regulatory loopholes, which divide the EU market and reduce control over it. Moreover, with the new Falsified Medicines Directive 2011/62/EU in place, offenders may consider replacing the production of medicines with that of supple- ments, and therefore it can be expected that the problem of drug- adulterated food supplements may expand. 4.

Impact of the food additives legislation The European legislation on food additives (EU, 1989, 1994a, b, 1995, 2002) is based upon the principle that substances added intentionally to foodstuffs to perform certain technological functions, can only be used for that purpose if they are explicitly authorized and taken up in official positive lists, and only subject to the specific restrictions laid down. For these officially accepted food additives, the Acceptable Daily Intake (ADI) is calcu- lated by making use of the outcome of a full toxicolog- ical dossier consisting of acute and repeated dose toxicity studies. This exercise is currently performed by the Euro- pean Food Safety Authority (EFSA) Scientific Panel on food additives, flavourings, processing aids and materials in contact with food.

(A-B-C) Co-treatment of some botanical extract (Basil 1, Nutmeg, Sassafrass) for 24 with 1\u2032-hydroxyestragol e and safrole (600 \u03bcM) in HepG2 cells A and B: Evaluation of genotoxic damage (tail length by alkaline comet test (pH > 13) C-, vehicle (DMSO 0.1%); C+ positive control (mitomycin 0.1 \u03bcg/ml). Data are evaluated through One Way Anova (Dunnett's post hoc test) analysis.(**p < 0.01 ***p < 0.001 vs C-). C Images of nucleoids obtained with comet assay with the different treatments: control DMSO, B 1\u2032OH estragole 600 \u03bcM, 1\u2032OH estragole 600 \u03bcM + Basil 1 700\u03bcg/ml. L. Marabini, et al. Regulatory Toxicology and Pharmacology 105 (2019) 36\u201341 40 because the co-exposure of the two hydroxymetabolites of estragole and safrole with the SULT inhibitor pentachlorophenol (PCP) clearly re- duces the mutagenic effects induced by hydroxy-derivatives alone. The results obtained with Mitomycin support the specificity of the toxicity due to sulfoxy metabolites, which does not follow the same metabolic pathway as Estragole and Safrole as it does not require sulfox- ymetabolite to exert its genotoxic activity. In conclusion, the original contribution of this research is to highlight the need to focus toxicity studies of botanical preparations more on the matrix (standardized extracts) than on the individual components present in the matrix. Conflicts of interest The authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential conflict of interest. Funding The research leading to these results has received funding from the European Community's Seventh Framework Programme (FP7/2007- 2013) under grant agreement n\u00b0 245199. It has been carried out within the PlantLIBRA project (website: www.plantlibra.eu). This report does not necessarily reflect the Commission views or its future policy on this area. This research was supported by grants from MIUR Progetto Eccellenza.

In addition, our analysis of the Belpoggi data demonstrates that the preva- lence of LCTs in MTBE-treated versus control rats was not statistically different when survival was appropriately taken into account. Thus, these data do not support a causal association between MTBE exposure and LCTs.

This detrimental effect, at least partly, may be related with oxida- tive stress-mediated PARP dependent pathway. Taken together, it is recommended that the exposure to ABM must be limited due to its hazardous effects on male fertility.

For IT tests of nanomaterials, setting the dose vol- ume between 0.5 and 2.0mL/kgwill yield pulmonary inflammatory responses of similar magnitude. Using dose volumes beyond this range may lead to alterations in inflammatory markers. Both the gavage needle and microaerosolizer are appropriate for hazard screening of nanomaterials. Because they were obtained by using insoluble, sphere-shaped TiO2, which induce transient inflamma- tion, the current results should be extrapolated to other materi- alsdespecially those that are more reactive or toxicdwith caution. In addition, testing parameters, such as time course, might require modification when highly toxic chemicals are screened and there- fore merit further investigation.

The results indicated that the increases of MUC5AC and ICAM-1 mRNA and protein levels were not significant in lungs and tracheas of rats exposed to SO2 alone compared with the control, but the elevated levels of these genes appeared in these tis- sues of rats exposed to SO2 plus OVA compared with either the control or exposure to OVA, suggesting that SO2 expo- sure could result in OVA-induced increases of transcription and translation levels of MUC5AC and ICAM-1 in lungs and tracheas of rats. At the same time, a synergistic effect on the pathological changes between SO2 and OVA was observed in lungs after co-exposure of SO2 and OVA. These results provide more useful evidences to understand the possible mechanism that SO2 pollution aggravates asthma disease. Analysis of the molecular mechanisms of asthma related-genes has led to a better understanding of asthma pathogenesis.

However, this substance appears to be effective in protecting against genetic damage. The fact that the administration of this substance is not associated with adverse effects and does not reduce the base frequency of micronu- clei provides evidence that this substance may be a chemopreven- tive factor against carcinogenesis. b-Glucan may also be used as an adjuvant in cancer chemotherapy, since concomitant nutritional therapy with antioxidants shows various benefits in the treatment of cancer patients, resulting in lowered side effects and allowing the continuation of cytotoxic treatment with diminished harm to the patient. In this manner it is still necessary more studies that evaluate the mechanism by which \u00df-glucan interfere in the gene expression to best understand why it was not capable to prevent the adverse phenotypes, once this same polysaccharide is capable of modulating an antimutagenic activity.

The correlations between scientific criteria indicated that these toxicological and physicochemical properties served as a qualitative indicator in support of a dichotomous recognition of skin exposure hazard. The predictive modeling was the most influ- ential criterion in association with the current notations, and the output of model prediction was consistent with the GHS classifica- tion of acute toxicity. These results suggest that the predictive model examined in this study may be considered for application as a semiquantitative criterion in dermal hazard ranking.

Firstly, sufficient knowledge relating to carcinogenicity must be adequately captured within the AOP construct. This may be public knowledge within the public literature or private knowledge generated as part of the drug development process. While still an emerging area, there are several initiatives currently underway developing AOPs with relevance to carcinogenicity assessment (AOP, Ball et al., 2021; Jacobs et al., 2020, Lynch et al., 2019; Sasaki et al., 2020 Cayley et al. in preparation]. These projects are capturing knowledge relating both to genotoxic [Ball et al., 2021; Sasaki et al., 2020, Lynch et al., 2019 Cayley et al. in preparation] and non-genotoxic mechanisms [Ball et al., 2021; Jacobs et al., 2020, Cayley et al. in preparation] of relevance. Work is also being undertaken to combine relevant AOPs into a coherent network and associate the appropriate evidence in the right places within a new piece of software [Ball et al., 2021; Kaptis, Cayley et al. in preparation]. Another impor- tant aspect requiring further development is the quantity of evidence and method by which it is reasoned on the AOP to reach a conclusion. Although using biological complexity reasoning mitigates some uncer- tainty, false positives may still arise, but having the information dis- played in a systematic way can facilitate expert assessment and judgment to derive conclusions based on the evidence available. Con- cepts, such as minimum amount of data thresholds or confidence mea- sures, are being researched and incorporation of these elements can refine how calls are made using such a concept. This approach to WoE assessment gives consistency to how evidence is applied and how calls are made. Further, a benefit of this concept is that as more NAMs and assays are developed, which avoid the use of animal models and are relevant to humans, these can be accommodated in this WoE approach and add to the body of evidence required to make a call, making it a true IATA. An example of this might relate to measuring the Ki-67 protein, the expression of which has been related to cell proliferation and acts as an important biomarker for cell prolifera- tion [Li et al., 2015; Sun and Kaufman, 2018]. Measuring of this biomarker may augment or replace the observation of cell hyperplasia in rodent assays in the future. As the concept evolves, amalgamation of more evidence from different sources will improve results. Finally, while the ICH S1 WoE approach gives a categorical call, it could be foreseen that using AOPs to make more quantitative calls, based on exposure, could be the key for risk assessment of carcinoge- nicity across many industries. This is contingent on relevant data being available, and the development of knowledge around quantitative in- terrelationships between KEs. 6. Conclusion Using AOPs for risk assessment is a good way of bringing evidence together and organising it in such a way that transparent, consistent, and robust decisions can be made as to potential concerns. This could be of advantage in a regulatory setting to ensure that submissions are consistent across industry. They may also be helpful in identifying knowledge gaps for specific chemicals in an assessment and provide guidance on how to address it. The recent draft addendum for the ICH S1 guidance gives a good opportunity to apply the principles to a real-life scenario and potentially start improving the way that carcinogenicity risk assessments are performed. The critical factors for the WoE assess- ment can be linked to the AOP network and an outcome for each of these could be made by connecting the evidence available, looking at how data relate to each other and reason between results to give an adverse outcome call for each factor, and thus reach a decision as to whether to conduct a carcinogenicity study. This approach will be useful in reach- ing consistent, transparent, and defensible conclusions as well as directing most appropriate testing and allowing for the facile absorption of new evidence. This can be particularly important in cases where a body of evidence does not give a clear-cut result and contextualisation using this approach can mitigate unneeded animal testing. The use of such a concept is a good foundation for further work, such that evolution of the approach can be robustly applied to make calls for ICH S1 and beyond.

Responsibility for the implementation of the Commission cross-Directorate guidelines on the collection and use of exper- tise lies within each Directorate. DG Research is responsible for commissioning an external evaluation of the eVectiveness of the guidelines. The Commission reports annually on pro- gress towards implementation of its Better Regulation Action Plan. Despite these recent changes, the standards set out in the good practices framework are not met at EU level. Since 1992, the ScientiWc and Technological Options Assessment (STOA) has provided scientiWc and technologi- cal advice to the European Parliament. Its original aim was to ensure that the Parliament had access to timely, high quality, independent assessments of scientiWc and techno- logical issues that were relevant to their work as legislators. To achieve this, STOA responded to information requests from parliamentary committees and undertook selected projects on its own initiative. Independent consultants car- ried out the work after projects were approved by the Members of the European Parliament (MEPs) on the STOA Panel."}},

With ever-increasing regulatory oversight, phar- maceutical companies are now addressing the issue of drug-in- duced liver injury more rigorously now than before. Diagnosing and managing DILI in the preclinical and clinical settings are chal- lenging and there is an immediate need for better processes and tools to characterize liver toxicity potential of compounds at vari- ous stages of development. Conventional biochemical tools like Anne LanevschiT and AST have limitations and are imperfect as biomarkers of DILI, indicating that there are a number of well defined approaches that can add value to their applications in the drug development setting. This perspective addresses some of these gaps and high- lights the need for better use of available diagnostic standards, indicating where there is scope for improvement. In addition this article has focused also on the unmet need for improved and novel biomarkers of liver toxicity (Table 2) and the role of regulatory agencies in enabling qualification of such markers. We encourage continued dialogue among pharmaceutical, academic, medical, and regulatory leaders to advance and improve the science of liver safety assessment in preclinical development and clinical practice.

Both their acute and chronic effects are generally unremarkable. Their sole toxic activity of any significance, the capacity to cause allergic reac- tions in the respiratory tract, is however one which must be the sub- ject of stringent control. A few cases of allergy among consumers using dusty enzyme detergents were reported before the risk was properly understood (PB 204 118. Report of the ad hoc Committee on Enzyme Detergents. Division of Medical Sciences. National Acad- emy of Sciences \u2013 National Research Council. Enzyme-Containing Laundering Compounds and Consumer Health. Supported by Food and Drug Administration. November 1971. (page 1\u201331, including 54 references). The subsequent assessment of this risk led to encap- sulation of the enzymes along with other formulation changes to ensure that consumer exposure levels were sufficiently low to ren- der the likelihood of either the induction of IgE mediated sensitiza- tion, or the elicitation of clinical symptoms, highly improbable. Understanding consumer exposure to enzymes used in laundry and cleaning products and comparison to safe benchmarks are the key steps in the risk management process (US SDA, 2005). Proof of the validity of the risk assessment conclusions and the risk manage- ment process only comes with practical experience and evidence from the marketplace. Thus, although microbial enzymes have been used in laundry detergent products for several decades, analysis of clinical data from a range of sources collected over the 40 years demonstrates only that there remains a very low background noise in the clinical testing for the presence of IgE to enzymes that has not changed materially over time (Sarlo et al., 2010). This confirms that the risk to consumers has been properly assessed and managed. Nevertheless, as enzyme use expands into new product categories, robust safety assessments that can include clinical trials need to be done to assure continued safe use of enzymes.

Both their acute and chronic effects are generally unremarkable. Their sole toxic activity of any significance, the capacity to cause allergic reac- tions in the respiratory tract, is however one which must be the sub- ject of stringent control. A few cases of allergy among consumers using dusty enzyme detergents were reported before the risk was properly understood (PB 204 118. Report of the ad hoc Committee on Enzyme Detergents. Division of Medical Sciences. National Acad- emy of Sciences \u2013 National Research Council. Enzyme-Containing Laundering Compounds and Consumer Health. Supported by Food and Drug Administration. November 1971. (page 1\u201331, including 54 references). The subsequent assessment of this risk led to encap- sulation of the enzymes along with other formulation changes to ensure that consumer exposure levels were sufficiently low to ren- der the likelihood of either the induction of IgE mediated sensitiza- tion, or the elicitation of clinical symptoms, highly improbable. Understanding consumer exposure to enzymes used in laundry and cleaning products and comparison to safe benchmarks are the key steps in the risk management process (US SDA, 2005). Proof of the validity of the risk assessment conclusions and the risk manage- ment process only comes with practical experience and evidence from the marketplace. Thus, although microbial enzymes have been used in laundry detergent products for several decades, analysis of clinical data from a range of sources collected over the 40 years demonstrates only that there remains a very low background noise in the clinical testing for the presence of IgE to enzymes that has not changed materially over time (Sarlo et al., 2010). This confirms that the risk to consumers has been properly assessed and managed. Nevertheless, as enzyme use expands into new product categories, robust safety assessments that can include clinical trials need to be done to assure continued safe use of enzymes.

Both their acute and chronic effects are generally unremarkable. Their sole toxic activity of any significance, the capacity to cause allergic reac- tions in the respiratory tract, is however one which must be the sub- ject of stringent control. A few cases of allergy among consumers using dusty enzyme detergents were reported before the risk was properly understood (PB 204 118. Report of the ad hoc Committee on Enzyme Detergents. Division of Medical Sciences. National Acad- emy of Sciences \u2013 National Research Council. Enzyme-Containing Laundering Compounds and Consumer Health. Supported by Food and Drug Administration. November 1971. (page 1\u201331, including 54 references). The subsequent assessment of this risk led to encap- sulation of the enzymes along with other formulation changes to ensure that consumer exposure levels were sufficiently low to ren- der the likelihood of either the induction of IgE mediated sensitiza- tion, or the elicitation of clinical symptoms, highly improbable. Understanding consumer exposure to enzymes used in laundry and cleaning products and comparison to safe benchmarks are the key steps in the risk management process (US SDA, 2005). Proof of the validity of the risk assessment conclusions and the risk manage- ment process only comes with practical experience and evidence from the marketplace. Thus, although microbial enzymes have been used in laundry detergent products for several decades, analysis of clinical data from a range of sources collected over the 40 years demonstrates only that there remains a very low background noise in the clinical testing for the presence of IgE to enzymes that has not changed materially over time (Sarlo et al., 2010). This confirms that the risk to consumers has been properly assessed and managed. Nevertheless, as enzyme use expands into new product categories, robust safety assessments that can include clinical trials need to be done to assure continued safe use of enzymes.

The prospective AHS has evaluated associations between glyphosate and all cancer sites (De Roos et al., 2005), with no sta- tistically significant results. Other studies, including cohort and case-control studies of specific cancers have similarly reported results generally consistent with the null hypothesis. These results are not surprising, given that glyphosate has been classified as a noncarcinogenic and non-mutagenic chemical (WHO/FAO, 2004). The AHS recently revised its exposure intensity algorithm by incor- porating biomonitoring data with information from the literature and from the Pesticides Handlers Exposure Database; however, it does not address potential pesticide-specific differences (Coble et al., 2011). Future studies could be improved by more careful attention to validating exposure to glyphosate and other herbicides or pesticides under study. With this in mind, further analyses of the AHS, with additional accrued cases, may be informative regard- ing associations with specific types of NHL and for more stable estimates of potential associations with multiple myeloma.

The absence of a clear dose response between smokers of 9 mg vs 4 mg smokers might be due to demographics and smoking behavior. It is of par- amount importance that subjects selected in such studies be repre- sentative of smokers of the selected tar yield product. In a review paper on clinical trials methods for evaluation of potential reduced exposure products (PREPs), it was suggested that the study population should be representative of the population of smokers or tobacco users with respect to gender, ethnicity, age and socio- economic status. Thus, ideally, a clinical study should aim at recruiting populations of smokers similar to the ones that are likely to use the products (Hatsukami et al., 2009), provided that there is prior knowledge about such populations.

In general, HS yields of 10 Canadian products led to observations supporting the conclu- sions of several studies which used different methodologies to esti- mate the exposure of smokers to cigarette smoke. Human smoking behavior is not adequately represented by the ISO or the Canadian intense smoking regimes but the same ranking order was obtained for HS yields and ISO and Canadian intense yields.

Based on the data presented here and in previously published ITS (Natsch et al., 2013; Bauch et al., 2012), it might be unnecessary to address additional key events, such as T-cell proliferation, as the current ITS are already proficient in the prediction of sensitizing potential of chemicals. As the costs and prediction accuracy of the testing strategies are similar, other characteristics become more important. The tiered approach is bet- ter able to correct for the limitations of the individual methods as only the most favorable characteristics of the KC methods are applied. On the other hand, the majority voting strategy is more straightforward, as it requires less different methods and is easier to evaluate. In conclusion, the combination of non-animal testing methods in a testing strategy provides a mechanistic basis for clas- sification and high prediction accuracy, although the strategy most suitable for implementation remains to be determined.

Studies to unravel the mechanis- tic actions for specific toxicants frequently require enormous investments of funding and research person- nel, and elucidation of the biological pathways leading to the expression of toxicity is often hampered by the \u201cblack box\u201d of data gaps. Furthermore, it is not unre- alistic to assume that a single chemical can have mul- tiple effects on a tissue or an organism, and the extent of recovery and/or compensatory mechanisms must also be taken into consideration. Given the complexity of these issues, the following assumptions have been made to render construction of BBDR models tenable: I. A major, or critical, mechanistic pathway is di- rectly responsible for the adverse developmental out- comes. II. Perturbation of this mechanistic pathway can be evaluated quantitatively relative to dose and time of exposure. III. Homologous mechanisms of toxicity via a specific pathway exist between test animal species and humans. For the past several years, a team of researchers at the US EPA/Reproductive Toxicology Division (R TylD) has been involved in construction of a BBDR model for the developmental toxicity of the chemotherapeutic agent 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) (Elstein et al., 1993, 1997; FIG. 1. Schematic representation of a BBDR model. Shaded boxes are parameters to be modeled. 1998; Lau et al., 1999; Setzer et al., 1999). 5-Fluorou- acil was selected as a prototypic developmental toxi- ant for this effort for three reasons: (a) the drug is a ell-established teratogen in several laboratory ani- al models including rat, mouse, chick, hamster, and onkey (Karnofsky et al., 1958; Dagg, 1960; Wilson, 971; Shah and McKay, 1978; Shuey et al., 1994a) and imilar anatomical defects have been reported in a uman case study (Stephens et al., 1980), suggesting omologous mechanisms of toxicity; (b) the molecular nd cellular mechanisms of action for the compound ave been studied extensively, and sensitive and quan- ifiable biomarkers are available for dose\u2013response valuations (Pinendo and Peters, 1988; Parker and heng, 1990); and (c) some of the defects induced by -FU (such as digit deformities and cleft palate) have een well characterized and the model can draw from a ealth of existing information (see reviews by Mu- eoka and Anderson, 1997; Zimmerman, 1997). Devel- pmental toxicity of 5-FU has been associated with our putative mechanisms of action that are depicted in ig. 2: (i) inhibition of thymidylate synthetase (TS and ossibly thymidine kinase) that leads to depletion of hymidylate and imbalance of the deoxyribonucleotide dNTP) pool and interference of DNA synthesis and cell ycle progression, causing abnormalities in cell repli- ation and/or cell death; (ii) direct incorporation of -FU derivatives into RNA that leads to the production f aberrant mRNA coding for nonfunctional proteins; iii) damage to DNA that causes cell death; and (iv) nduction of fetal hepatotoxicity that leads to fetal ane- ia (Shuey et al., 1994b). Data from the EPA studies suggested that the extent to which 5-FU derivatives were incorporated into nucleic acids was too low to account for a major cellular insult in embryos (Lau et al., 1999), whereas the fetal anemia probably provided a secondary cause or represented a downstream conse- quence of the 5-FU toxicity (Shuey et al., 1994c). Hence, 5-FU-induced TS inhibition and the resultant cellular perturbations were the focus for modeling (Fig. 2, shaded boxes). Several investigators have previously modeled the metabolism of DNA precursors using substrate concen- trations measured in aggregates of cells and enzyme characteristics measured in vitro (Werkheiser et al., 1973; Jackson, 1984; Heinmets, 1989; Heinmets and Leary, 1992; Setzer, 1993). This approach would seem to be ideal for building a BBDR for risk assessment purposes; extrapolation across species (e.g., from rats to humans) could then be accomplished by substituting the appropriate enzyme kinetic parameters and modi- fying the appropriate toxicokinetics. The uncertainty in the prediction of human health risk, for a given exposure, would be largely the result of statistical un- certainties in the parameter estimates. However, these models make at least two critical assumptions: that the"}},

Some of the EDSP ESB assays are not mechanistic, and others have yet to be shown to meet the basic requirement of distinguishing an endocrine active substance from a negative control. The cost and the time required to conduct the current EDSP ESB are also of con- cern. While staging the EDSP ESB and conducting a WOE evalua- tion, as we recommend, may improve interpretation as to whether a substance may interact with components of the estro- gen, androgen and thyroid hormone systems, these recommenda- tions cannot overcome inherent limitations of the EDSP ESB assays. Therefore, it seems most logical to make a full stop after this first set of 50\u2013100 substances have been assessed in the EDSP ESB in order to evaluate the performance of the program, as EPA\u2019s SAB/SAP recommended (US EPA, 1999a). Given that the majority of substances required to be evaluated by EPA in this initial phase of the EDSP are pesticide active ingredients with existing robust tox- icity datasets, including many studies that correspond to EDSP Tier 2 apical tests, a valuable comparison could be made by arraying the EDSP ESB results alongside the apical test results. At that time, the results should be fully analyzed to eliminate from the EDSP ESB those assays that are redundant and those that are not endocrine specific. This would also permit incorporation of new and revised screens that are mechanistically specific, rapid, reliable, minimize the use of lab animals, and that provide the needed data in a more cost effective manner. With such analyses and improvements, the net result should be a more robust, scientifically valid EPA endo- crine screening program.

We propose that an analogous antibody should be adopted for preclinical safety testing only if it meets a priori established criteria with respect to pharmacological and toxicological activity. In this instance, while the analogous antibody (muM17) does not recognize the same epitope as the clinical agent (efalizumab) the phar- macological activity is very similar. It is clearly an open debate as to just how similar this activity needs to be in every case, and this will be dependent on the compara- tive biology between the surrogate species and humans, as well as the availability of preclinical models and bio- markers of activity. In the case of muM17 the down- modulation of CD11a on T cells proved to be an extremely useful biomarker of comparative activity be- tween the species and molecules.

Air concentrations derived based on the TOC or N\u2013L ratio approach will be used as generic ESLs in Texas for chemicals that have limited toxicity infor- mation in order to evaluate short-term one-hour exposures. The generic ESLs will be used in the TCEQ air permitting process to assess the protectiveness of substance-specific emission rate limits for facilities undergoing air permit reviews. If the GLCmax, a worst case concentration resulting from a worst case emission rate, is below the generic ESL for that chemical, the substance can be judged, with reason- able confidence, to present a low probability of risk.

Since these studies are largely not predictive of human cancer risk, both pharmaceutical compa- nies and regulatory agencies should aim at their replacement. The collaborative assessment of existing carcinogenicity data from pharmaceutical companies utilising new approaches to identify potentially human relevant or irrelevant mechanisms of carcinoge- nicity including genetically modified animal models and in vitro carcinogenicity screening assays based on gene expression profil- ing (Vinken et al., 2008; Bercu et al., 2010) are likely to improve the current carcinogenicity testing paradigm without the need of long-term rodent carcinogenicity studies.

This paper has focused on the impact of exposure to diacetyl vapors. A similar analysis, applying dosimetry adjustments or based directly on par- ticulate-based studies that may be conducted in the future, would be needed to estimate an OEL for aerosols or powders. Additional key questions that would further improve the degree of confidence in the assessments relate to better understanding of the mecha- nism of fibrotic responses, the role of peak vs. cumulative expo- sures, and the potential for sensitization-based responses of the skin and/or respiratory tract. Although the analysis presented here focused on OEL setting for diacetyl, it is likely that similar issues will need to be addressed for related flavor ingredients.

Expression of Cyp3a11 and Cyp3a25 in liver. Mice were administrated orally with cinnabar (300 mg/kg), AGNH (3000 mg/kg), MeHg (2.6 mg/kg) and HgCl2 (32 mg/kg), daily for 44 days. Total RNA was isolated for real-time RT-PCR analysis. Data are mean \u00b1 SE of six mice. \u2044Significantly different from controls, p < 0.05. 210 Y.-F. Lu et al. / Regulatory Toxicology and Pharmacology 60 (2011) 206\u2013211 enzyme genes by MeHg is associated with its adverse effects to the liver. Cyp4a10 mRNA can be induced by chemicals that produce liver injury (Bartosiewicz et al., 2001). In the present study, Cyp4a10 was induced by MeHg and HgCl2. However, their expressions were not changed after cinnabar and AGNH administration, indicating that induction of Cyp4a10 by MeHg and HgCl2 could be a hepato- toxicity manifestation of MeHg and HgCl2. Cyp3a11 and Cyp3a25 are major phase-I xenobiotic metaboliz- ing enzymes and are regulated by PXR. Many environmental chem- icals and drugs, such as dexamethasone and carbamazepine, induce Cyp3a enzymes and transporters for efflux (Xu et al., 2005). For example, induction of Cyp3a11 plays an important role in protecting against acetaminophen-induced hepatotoxicity (Guo et al., 2004). In the present study, Cyp3a11 and Cyp3a25 were in- creased by AGNH, cinnabar, and common mercurial compounds, suggesting that the induction of Cyp3a enzymes could be an adap- tive mechanism for mercurial exposure. Considering the important role of Cyp3a enzymes in drug metabolism, their induction could produce potential Hg-drug interactions, especially after long-term use of cinnabar and AGNH. Cinnabar is an important ingredient frequently used in tradi- tional Chinese medicines (Pharmacopoeia of China, 2005), includ- ing the patented formulas as AGNH and Zhu-Sha-An-Shen Wan ( , Shi et al., 2011). The pharmacological basis of including cinnabar in these remedies is not clear, but the rationale for re- moval of cinnabar from these recipes is not clear, too. Cinnabar- containing traditional medicines are over-the-counter remedy used for insomnia, anxiety, and depression (Zhou et al., 2009). It has been shown to have beneficial effects on sleep-phase modula- tion in insomnia rats (Jin et al., 2008), and to potentiate the tran- quil effects of pentobarbital (Gao et al., 2008). However, more work in the field is needed to justify the existence of Hg in tradi- tional medicines. In conclusion, the present study demonstrated that cinnabar and cinnabar-containing AGNH were much less toxic than MeHg and HgCl2 to the liver. The differential toxic potential appears to be due, at least in part, to the disposition of the metal, and to the induction of oxidative stress and disruption of cytochrome P450 enzyme genes. Thus, chemical forms of mercury are important factors in determining their disposition and toxicity. Y.-F.

Apart from one sample, the concentrations of Cd were below the Cana- dian specified limit of 3 mg g\ufffd1. On the other hand, the concentra- tions of Pb in a significant proportion of the brands investigated were above the Canadian limit of 10 mg g\ufffd1. The systemic exposure dosage values for these metals obtained from the application of these brands of bathing soaps and shower gels were below their respective provisional tolerable daily intake (PTDI)/or recom- mended daily intake (RDI) values. The margin of safety values ob- tained for the metals in the tested samples were greater than 100 which indicated that there is no significant risk to the users of these brands of bathing soaps and shower gels, except in the case of Co for some of the samples. The concentrations of metals in the tested samples differed significantly with respect to the product types and their origin, which reflects the differences in the production pro- cesses, raw materials used and regulatory control limits applicable in those regions.

Since mitochondria are redox active organelles, there is a likelihood of altering ROS production and thereby over-loading or interfering with anti-oxidant defenses. The engineered nanoparticles have been shown to release oxyradicals (Derfus et al., 2004; Joo et al. 2004; Yamakoshi et al. (2003), which can interact with the anti-oxidant de- fense system.

Initial body weights ranged from 100 to 120 g. All animals were subjected to physical examination for clinical signs of ill health and were observed within 7 days of arrival. Following acclimatization for 7 days, animals were re-examined and weighed. In the 21-day study, animals were randomly assigned to five groups of 5 males and 5 females on the basis of body weight. In the 90-day study, rats whose weight variation exceeded two standard deviations of the mean weight of each sex were eliminated from study selection. Rats were randomly assigned to four groups of 20 males and 20 females on the basis of body weight. In both studies, initial mean body weights and weight distributions were similar in each group. Animals were individually housed in suspended stainless steel, open-mesh cages in environmentally controlled rooms (23 \u00b1 2 \ufffdC, 12-h light/dark cycle, 30\u201370% relative humidity, ventilation frequency of 10\u201315 times/h). All procedures were conducted in compliance with the Animal Welfare Act, the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals, and the Office of Laboratory Animal Welfare. Test diets were prepared by serial dilution of MBE containing 94% magnolol and 1.5% honokiol (Li et al. (2007) with the basal powdered diet [Vital River Laboratory Animal Technology Co., Ltd (Beijing, China)]. MBE was mixed with a small amount of basal diet and sieved through a 20-mesh sieve, then further mixed with basal diet followed by sieving until the test material was completely mixed in the diet. In the 21-day study, test diets were prepared weekly and were stored at room temperature. In week 1 of the study, the formulated diet was based on historical food consumption data, while formulations for weeks 2 and 3 were based on food consumption per 100 g/bw in the previous week\u2019s feed- ing interval for each group. Diet formulations are provided in Table 1. In the 90-day study, diets were prepared weekly in the first month and biweekly thereafter, and were stored at room temperature. In week 1 of the study, the formulated diet was based on data for food consumption from the 21-day study, while all subsequent formulations were based on food consumption per 100 g/bw in the previous week for each group. Since the potential use of MBE in food would result in a safety margin of greater than 15, 000-fold, the 240 mg/kg bw dose (where no evidence of toxicity was observed during the dose ranging study), was considered adequate for use as the upper dose in the 90-day sub-chronic study. Thus, animals received MBE at levels of 0, 60, 120 or 240 mg/kg bw/day. Food and tap water were supplied ad libitum except during scheduled fasting periods, in which food was removed. 2.2. Analysis of dietary mixtures The stability, homogeneity, and MBE content of the test diets were analyzed. For stability testing in the 21-day study, the formulated diets for the 60 mg/kg bw group prepared in week 1 and for the 120 mg/kg bw group prepared in week 2 for the female group were sampled immedi- ately after preparation and following storage for 1 week at room temper- ature. The homogeneity and content of MBE in the diets was determined by collecting 50-g samples from the top, middle, and bottom of the diets prepared each time during the study for the 60 mg/kg bw group in week 1 and for the 120 mg/kg bw female group in week 2.

Liu et al. / Regulatory Toxicology and Pharmacology 49 (2007) 160\u2013171 In the 90-day study, the formulated diets for the 60 and 240 mg/kg bw group prepared in week 1 were sampled immediately after preparation and on day 14 following storage at room temperature to assess the stability of the diet. The homogeneity and content of MBE in the diets was deter- mined by collecting 50-g samples from the top, middle, and bottom of the diets prepared each time during the study for the 60 and 240 mg/kg bw female groups. In both studies, MBE content was analyzed by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and compared with the formulation input (target values). 2.3. Animal observations Animals were observed twice daily for clinical signs and mortality. Food spillage was also assessed twice daily by visual inspection of the amount of food droppings beneath each cage. In the 21-day study, body weights were measured at the start of treatment (day 0), on days 1, 4, 8, 10, 14, 16, 20 and 21, and at study termination following fasting. Food consumption measurements were taken on day 1, over days 2\u20133 and 4\u20137 in the first week of the study. Thereafter, food consumption was measured weekly, and the total food consumption, food utilization in each week, and the total food utilization (weight gain per 100 g food consumed) was calculated at the end of the study. In the 90-day study, body weights were measured prior to treat- ment, weekly during treatment, and at study termination after fasting. Food consumption was determined weekly and total food consump- tion for each animal was calculated at the end of the study. Food utilization in each week and total food utilization during the study were also determined. Prior to treatment, all animals were subjected to ophthalmic examination using an indirect ophthalmoscope follow- ing dilation of eyes with tropicamide. Animals in the control and high-dose groups also underwent ophthalmic examinations at week 13. 2.4. 21-Day pilot oral toxicity study 2.4.1. Hematology and serum/plasma chemistry On day 22, rats were anesthetized with 3% sodium pentobarbital fol- lowing an overnight fast for 16\u201318 h. Blood was collected from caval veins for analysis of hematology, coagulation parameters, and serum chemistry parameters. Hematology measurements included: red blood cell count (RBC), hemoglobin, hematocrit, mean corpuscular volume, mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration, mean corpuscular hemoglobin, platelet count, white blood cell count (WBC), differential blood cell count, and reticulo- cyte count. A bone marrow smear was also taken from the sternum and was fixed, stained and examined for the following parameters: myelo- blasts, promyelocytes, myelocytes, metamyelocytes, stab nucleus neutro- phils, lobocytes, eosinophils, basophils, proerythroblasts, early normoblasts, intermediate normoblasts, late normoblasts, lymphocytes, plasma cells, monocytes, and myeloid-to-erythroid ratio (Lu et al., 2004). Hematology parameters were measured using an automated hema- toanalyzer (MEK-7222J/K, NIHON KOHDEN). To assess coagulation, prothrombin time (PT) and activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT) were determined from plasma, using sodium citrate as an anticoagulant (Lu et al., 2004). Coagulation parameters were analyzed by an automated hematocoagulation parameter (MC-4000 PLUS, Medicine Devices GmbH & Co. KG). For serum chemistry analysis, blood was centrifuged and serum was separated. Serum chemistry parameters included: glucose, urea nitrogen (BUN), creatinine, alanine aminotransferase (ALT), c-glutamyltransferase (GGT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), total protein, albumin, choles- terol, triglycerides, total bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase (ALP), calcium, inorganic phosphorus, sodium, potassium, and chloride (Lu et al., 2004). Parameters were analyzed using an automatic clinical analyzer (7080, Hitachi High-Technologies Corporation). 2.4.2. Urinalysis Urine was collected for 16\u201318 h prior to blood collection, and was assessed for: appearance/color, specific gravity, pH, protein, glucose, ketones, bilirubin, blood, urobilinogen, nitrite, and leukocytes (Lu et al., 2004). Urinalysis was conducted using a urine analyzer (Combi SCAN 100, Analyticon Biotechnologies, AG, Germany). Urine chemistry measurements included: calcium, sodium, potassium, phosphorus, and chloride. These were measured using an autoanalyzer (7080, Hitachi High-Technologies Corporation). 2.4.3. Clinical pathology and histopathology All rats were humanely euthanized with sodium pentobarbital follow- ing blood sample collection, and a complete necropsy was performed. Organ weights were obtained for the adrenal glands (2), brain, epididymis (2), heart, kidneys (2), liver, spleen, ovaries (2), stomach (without con- tents), testes (2), thymus, thyroid (2 lobes) with parathyroid, and uterus. Paired organs were weighed together. Organ-to-body weight ratios (rela- tive weight) were also calculated. In addition to the above-mentioned organs, several tissues (when present) were sampled and fixed in 10% neu- tral-buffered formalin. These included the aorta, cecum, colon, cervix, duodenum, esophagus, eyes (2), femur with bone marrow, ileum, jejunum, lacrimal gland, lung, lymph node, mammary gland, nasal turbinates, pan- creas, Peyer\u2019s patches, pituitary gland, prostate, rectum, salivary gland, sciatic nerve, seminal vesicles (2), skeletal muscle (thigh), skin, spinal cord, sternum with bone marrow, trachea, urinary bladder, vagina, and Zym- bal\u2019s gland. All stored organs and tissues from each animal in the control, 240, and 480 mg/kg bw/day groups were embedded in paraffin, sectioned, stained with Hematoxylin and Eosin, and subjected to microscopic examination.

If the RoCP is continued, it should accelerate the number of agents it reviews and revise its classification to in- clude at least three (known, probable and possible human carcin- ogen) and preferably five categories of agents. These five categories should be similar or identical to those used by the IMP and by the US Environmental Protection Agency (US Environmen- tal Protection Agency, 2005). Consideration should be given to moving the RoCP to the National Cancer Institute (NCI). This agency has a broad base of resources and experience in the study of cancer causation and is well suited to meeting the original con- gressional mandate. The NCI was the proposed location of the RoCP in the original House of Representatives version of the enabling legislation. No matter where the program is located, the classifica- tion of agents should be made by expert panels. RoCP staff should be limited to administrative, bibliographic and logistical functions.

Compared to partial urine or spot urine, 24-h urine collection is considered the most accurate approach to measure excretion of the metabolites generated from exposure to HPHCs. Furthermore the HPHCs measured in this study cover multiple chemical classes, toxicity grades, half-lives, gas and particulate phases, and forma- tion temperatures, providing indication that THS 2.2 reduces exposure to a broad spectrum of HPHCs. In conclusion, this study showed that ad libitum use of THS 2.2 for 5 days reduced bio- markers of exposure to 15 HPHCs as comparedwith continuing CCs, and that decreases in the THS group approached those observed after smoking abstinence. The observed reductions in biomarkers of exposure to HPHCs occurred despite an increase in tobacco stick use and changes in puffing behavior compared with CC use. Although the scores for product evaluation and the sensory expe- rience for THS 2.2 were lower than those for CCs, urge-to-smoke reduction and aversion reduction over time indicate that THS 2.2 offers a suitable alternative to CCs, although it may take longer than 5 days to complete adaptation to THS 2.2. THS 2.2 was well toler- ated and had a safety profile comparable with CCs.

Developing predic- tive classifiers for complex biological data sets like in vivo data is challenging; there are generally more features than instances (curse of dimensionality). The classification variable and input features are noisy, and there are many irrelevant signals with no causal connection to the value. In vivo studies used to build the models show variable responses, even for the same chemical, the same effects might be observed at different ranges, due to intraspecies variability or test method used. It must be noted that the final goal of in silico models is to predict the in vivo effects in humans for a given chemical and models can never be more accurate than the test data on which they are based. Acute toxicity tests on animals, whether using the LD50 or other protocols, have never undergone formal validation to modern standards to establish their relevance for humans (Langley, 2005). Therefore, it is extremely important to be aware of the accuracy and reproducibility of the test data used for making a model. Non-relevance of acute dermal toxicity testing for assessing human health protection has been already discussed by Latorre et al., (2019). Preferably, the relevance and design of AOT studies for human health should be further examined and discussed, since rat LD50 data often gives ambiguous information and has little value in management and treatment of drug and chemical substances overdose. 5. Conclusions The alternative methods all allow the application of the 3R princi- ples: replace, reduce or refine. The non-testing methods (NTM), such as the (Q)SAR, SAR, and read-across, offer a practical and economic approach that reduces the costs, but most importantly the number of test animals. For regulatory use and in the context of REACH, in silico methods may be used in combination with other information sources when building a Weight-of-Evidence (WoE) case, or as a component of an Integrated Approaches to Testing and Assessment (IATA) (Benfenati, 2019), mainly for materials of low acute oral toxicity (i.e. not classified). With an increasing number of chemicals to assess and a lack of reliable in vitro approaches, in silico models provide an alternative to predict AOT (and other hazard endpoints) and fill the data gaps. Pre- dictions generated by in silico tools may be useful to those developing or triaging new chemicals or for prioritizing existing chemicals for more detailed and rigorous toxicity assessments. Apart from these obvious aspects, the limitations of animal models and the validity of extrapo- lating animal data to human effects have been widely discussed, espe- cially in terms of reproducibility and relevance issues (Pham et al., 2020; Nelms et al., 2020; Hoffmann et al., 2010). Our goal in this paper was to determine if any of the five prediction tools (or a combination) could assist with identifying a chemical\u2019s AOT hazards. Our evaluation shows that in silico tools can help to identify non-toxic substances and aid in assigning GHS hazard categories or DG status. Data used for building the model is demonstrating some level of variability, it is expected that predictions will display a certain vari- ability as well, especially when considering multi-class metrics and Category-to-Category fit.

Developing predic- tive classifiers for complex biological data sets like in vivo data is challenging; there are generally more features than instances (curse of dimensionality). The classification variable and input features are noisy, and there are many irrelevant signals with no causal connection to the value. In vivo studies used to build the models show variable responses, even for the same chemical, the same effects might be observed at different ranges, due to intraspecies variability or test method used. It must be noted that the final goal of in silico models is to predict the in vivo effects in humans for a given chemical and models can never be more accurate than the test data on which they are based. Acute toxicity tests on animals, whether using the LD50 or other protocols, have never undergone formal validation to modern standards to establish their relevance for humans (Langley, 2005). Therefore, it is extremely important to be aware of the accuracy and reproducibility of the test data used for making a model. Non-relevance of acute dermal toxicity testing for assessing human health protection has been already discussed by Latorre et al., (2019). Preferably, the relevance and design of AOT studies for human health should be further examined and discussed, since rat LD50 data often gives ambiguous information and has little value in management and treatment of drug and chemical substances overdose. 5. Conclusions The alternative methods all allow the application of the 3R princi- ples: replace, reduce or refine. The non-testing methods (NTM), such as the (Q)SAR, SAR, and read-across, offer a practical and economic approach that reduces the costs, but most importantly the number of test animals. For regulatory use and in the context of REACH, in silico methods may be used in combination with other information sources when building a Weight-of-Evidence (WoE) case, or as a component of an Integrated Approaches to Testing and Assessment (IATA) (Benfenati, 2019), mainly for materials of low acute oral toxicity (i.e. not classified). With an increasing number of chemicals to assess and a lack of reliable in vitro approaches, in silico models provide an alternative to predict AOT (and other hazard endpoints) and fill the data gaps. Pre- dictions generated by in silico tools may be useful to those developing or triaging new chemicals or for prioritizing existing chemicals for more detailed and rigorous toxicity assessments. Apart from these obvious aspects, the limitations of animal models and the validity of extrapo- lating animal data to human effects have been widely discussed, espe- cially in terms of reproducibility and relevance issues (Pham et al., 2020; Nelms et al., 2020; Hoffmann et al., 2010). Our goal in this paper was to determine if any of the five prediction tools (or a combination) could assist with identifying a chemical\u2019s AOT hazards. Our evaluation shows that in silico tools can help to identify non-toxic substances and aid in assigning GHS hazard categories or DG status. Data used for building the model is demonstrating some level of variability, it is expected that predictions will display a certain vari- ability as well, especially when considering multi-class metrics and Category-to-Category fit.

The food panel clearly identified a limited predictability of 3R methods/lack of validation as the major barrier in the implementation of 3R methods (Factor 1, Table 1). In addition, insufficient guidance is a defined barrier (Factor 3, Table 1). These two barriers may be very much related. Concerns about pre- dictability, lack of validated methods and guidance for regulators also apply to 3R methods for kinetics (Punt et al., 2017; Coecke et al., 2013; Bessems et al., 2014). In vitro methods for kinetics capture individual aspects of kinetic processes, including for example absorption and metabolic rates of a compound. For most in vitro kinetic methods (e.g. Caco-2 permeability, metabolism measurements with microsomes or hepatocytes), reported experimental conditions within scientific lit- erature are manifold and no uniform protocols have been developed. No standardized procedures are also available for the integration of in vitro kinetic data with in silico physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) models (Paini et al., 2017). Given that from a scientific point of view, the predictability of these 3R methods for kinetics is generally good (Punt et al., 2017), there is a need to develop standardized pro- tocols and validation of these protocols, specifying also the boundaries of the different assays (e.g. type of chemicals that fall in a specific applicability domain) and acceptance criteria for risk assessors (e.g. time-range experiments, checks for linearity) (Brooks et al., 2004). These results indicate the importance of policy strategies to steer op- portunities, not only for the development of new methods, but espe- cially for adequate validation of existing 3R methods. The involvement of risk assessors in the development and validation of 3R methods for kinetics is essential to meet the need for guidance for regulators/in- dustry. The need for funding is supported by a comment of one of the stakeholders, who indicated that there is currently a \u201cLack of funding for proper validation and development of alternative techniques\u201d (Table 1, factor 10). Recommendation 3: Creating (funding) opportunities for valida- tion of non-animal methods for kinetics and the development of gui- dances. Recommendation 3: Creating (funding) opportunities for valida- tion of non-animal methods for kinetics and the development of gui- dances. 4. Conclusion In conclusion, the stakeholder opinions revealed various critical factors that influence the development and regulatory acceptance of 3R methods within food safety evaluations. These include i) uncertain predictability of 3R methods/lack of validation (barrier), ii) the possi- bility of 3R methods to provide more mechanistic information (driver), iii) insufficient guidance regulators/industry (barrier) and iv) in- sufficient harmonization of legislation (barrier). Given that the expert panel consisted of toxicologists from academia, industry, and regulatory authorities, it should be noted that the identified factors predominantly presents a scientists\u2019 perspective. Inclusion of stakeholders from the public domain, such as NGOs, was beyond the scope of the present study, but could provide relevant additional insights, e.g. on moral is- sues. Using the stakeholder opinions to define a policy strategy towards the inclusion of 3R methods for kinetics in regulatory safety evaluations of food chemicals, indicate the importance of steering regulatory data requirements as well as creating (funding) opportunities for the de- velopment and validation of 3R kinetic methods and the development of guidances.

These data indicate that fluoxetine and fluvoxamine partition into other environmental compartments (e.g., sediments, etc.); thus, the concentration in these compartments may be higher than in the water column. On day-48 of the dissipation assessment, there was an increase in the concentration of fluvoxamine compared to the previous- ly measured days. This indicates the potential for events to occur that could lead to a larger than normal release of sequestered pharmaceutical causing acute exposure at greater than predicted concentrations. At present, there is no published information regarding the SSRI binding to sediments, however, predicted KOC values indicate that this is likely occurring. This could indicate an in- creased exposure to benthos, submerged macrophytes, and even fish in areas of turbid water associated with effluent dominated steams. The identification of the compartment to which these pharmaceuticals are parti- tioning would allow for a more specific effects assess- ment and risk characterization as it could focus on the group to which exposure would be greatest and allow for the determination of the potential for greater than normal release events.

Results from the present clinical study are consistent with the results obtained for these heated tobacco products in other studies. Taking the results for our HC together with those for other heated tobacco products, cigarettes that involve heating tobacco leaves at a low temperature rather than combusting tobacco leaves at higher temperatures, as with conventional cigarettes, can effectively reduce total exposure to MSCs. Further developments in heated tobacco technology are likely to play one of the significant roles in future PREPs.

Therefore, comparison of in vitro effect concentrations to effective plasma concentrations of humans or rodents was consid- ered as a key to improve the correlation. Approaches to provide pharmacokinetic data that allow to identify plasma concentrations corresponding to LD50 have been initiated (Noorlander et al., 2008). However, the number of compounds for which such data are avail- able is currently very limited and no systematic survey or approach to generate these data has been initiated. In order to investigate the principal predictive capacity of fish embryos it would be neces- sary to identify plasma concentrations corresponding to LD50 con- centrations. If a correlation with fish embryo data could be established subsequent approaches would be needed to predict oral, dermal or inhalative effect concentrations using e.g., physio- logically based kinetic modelling (Louisse et al., 2010). 5.

The use of an internal standard represents a specific advantage of this protocol. Overall, a high specificity but rather low sensitivity could be found thereby hampering the prediction of in vivo severe irritants and irritants. Possible limitations can be observed with the assessment of solids. Though the HET-CAnnette Mehling does not reflect part of the irreversible effects in vivo, the data can be used in a WoE approach in combination with additional information, includ- ing data on similar substances and results from other in vitro meth- ods in a battery or tiered approach. Currently the application of the HET-CAnnette Mehling for EU GHS as stand-alone method is officially accepted by EU authorities for the identification of severe irritants only. The very low rate of false positives in the current study indicates that this will usually not lead to an overestimation of the eye irritating potential. Use of the HET-CAnnette Mehling method described in this study should prove helpful in a tiered or WoE approach in particular to identify non-irritants.

Safety requires proof of a reasonable certainty that no harm will result from the proposed use of an additive,\u201d (House of Representatives Report No. 2284, 85th Congress, 1958.) FDA, in regulations issued subsequent to the passage of the statute (21 CFR 170.3(i)) codified the definition of \u2018\u2018safe\u201d as follows: \u2018\u2018Safe or safety means that there is a reasonable certainty in the minds of competent scientists that the substance is not harmful under the intended conditions of use. It is impossible in the present state of scientific knowledge to establish with complete certainty the absolute harmlessness of the use of any substance.\u201d Thus, the standard is, in fact, a \u2018\u2018reasonable certainty of no harm\u201d standard, where harm is \u2018\u2018harm to health.\u201d Over the years, FDA officials have written much on what the reasonable certainty of no harm standard means and does not mean. One thing it does not mean is, \u2018\u2018Certainty of no theoretical possibility of harm.\u201d In the end, however, the standard as applied must indeed ensure safety. It results in decisions inevitably made without absolute certainty, but always based on a fair evaluation of all the data. Application of the standard must, in the end, protect public health, where any residual uncertainty is not out of line with what has been previously considered acceptable in the context of all previous similar safety decisions. (Notably, the so-called \u2018\u2018Delaney Clause\u201d of the Act explicitly prohibits the approval of any additive shown to cause cancer in man or other animals. The food additive Delaney Clause, one of three such clauses in the Act [the others applying to color additives and animal drugs respectively], states in part at Section 409(c)(3)(A), that, \u2018\u2018no additive shall be deemed to be safe if it is found to induce cancer when ingested by man or animal. . ..\u201d) FDA\u2019s safety decisions on food additives do not weigh \u2018\u2018benefits\u201d of any kind (it is a safety per se standard) and are not intended to limit or enforce consumer choices among safe foods. Finally, the safety standard as applied must be able to withstand scientific, procedural and legal challenges from all sides. FDA\u2019s decisions based on this standard have consistently done this for the past fifty years, virtually without exception. i.e., they have relatively little acute toxicity. Rather, the adverse ef- fects of interest to FDA safety reviewers are usually more subtle and likely to be observed most clearly in animal feeding studies only after a lifetime of exposure (24 months typically). Ultimately, once ap- proved, food additives must be safe for everyone\u2014children and the very young; teenagers and adults; the elderly; pregnant and lactating women. It is assumed that every population subgroup may poten- tially be exposed to the additive in their diet, and possibly for their en- tire lifetime. If the use of an additive that is safe for most consumers could present special risks for certain subpopulations, such as those who might be allergic to a particular ingredient or who may have an inborn metabolic deficiency such as phenylketonuria, for example, then FDA can require special labeling so those consumers are properly informed. In addition, unlike the case of drugs, FDA promulgates \u2018\u2018generic\u201d regulations for food additives, not a \u2018\u2018product-specific\u201d ap- proach as with drugs. Except for the case where a use of an additive is protected by a patent, any company that is in compliance with the conditions of use of the additive specified in the permitting regu- lation in the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) may use the additive in food in the way prescribed and within the purview of that regulation. 4.

Some of the other important smoking-re- lated factors were number of years smoked, smoking behavior questions from the FTND, topography parameters (i.e. total puff duration and puff count) and tar yield categories. When daily expo- sure to nicotine is adjusted by daily cigarette butts returned (NE per cig), the most important factors contributing to exposure are the topography parameters (total puff volume, puff count and total inter-puff interval). In conclusion, the models investigated in the study, explain about 30\u201340% of variability in daily exposure to nic- otine and carbon monoxide.

In patients, uncertainty is caused by the unpredictability of reactions and the concern about whether avoid- ance strategies will be effective enough. Variability of symptoms and the lack of markers do not allow stratification of patients according to their reactivity, and force health professionals to give the same advice to all patients despite the fact that the risk to each is not identical. Regulators and the food industry struggle with the fact that the lack of management thresholds forces them to make case-by-case decisions in an area of uncertainty with penalties for under- or over-prediction. As discussed above, agreed manage- ment thresholds for allergenic foods could lessen the uncertainty both for patients, regulators and food industry. They could also help health professionals in communicating the risk to their pa- tients. A prerequisite to setting such thresholds set is the system- atic collection of challenge data, using consistent protocols, from a representative sample of the full range of food-allergic individu- als including those at greatest risk. As zero risk is not a realistic possibility, consensus on acceptable risk will also be needed.

While some member states might disagree with this conclusion, it is consistent with the legal principles and court decisions now extant. Additional support for the use of the principle of mutual recognition for food-contact materials can be found in the European Council resolution on mutual recognition of 28 October 1999.70 In this resolution, the Many materials are cleared on the basis of two geno- toxicity studies when the estimated dietary intake is quite low; others will require the conducting of 90-day feeding studies; and, rarely, a 2-year study will be needed. The process, however, can be easily summarized by saying you start with extraction data extrapolated into dietary intake, add the indicated toxicity data based on the extraction work, and bring about a clearance that permits the use of the material in contact with all of the foods for which it is intended. Under the Petition system, J.H. Heckman / Regulatory Toxicology and Pharmacology 42 (2005) 96\u2013122 119 the Regulation issued would then indicate the speciWca- tions for the material and its intended use. Under the NotiWcation system, the speciWcations are in the Notice, as is the intended use. In both cases, once the regulatory process has been completed, there are no imponderables for an end user (e.g., a food packager) to try to deter- mine. All he need do is make certain he is purchasing materials that comply with the regulatory speciWcations and his compliance is assured. In Europe to obtain approval of an application for an assessment leading to the addition of a substance to the Plastics Directive, the basic ingredient required is the submission of three genotoxicity tests, along with all other pertinent toxicity data, that can be evaluated lead- ing to the setting of a permitted exposure level. Extrac- tion data obtained by exposing samples of the product to be cleared to water, 3% acetic acid, and olive oil (in some cases 95% ethanol, or some other fat can be used if it can be shown that olive oil will not work) must also be submitted. Up to now, the extraction work has been provided by testing done with the 10\u20131 ratio of solvent to surface area. However, the extraction data is not used to develop a dietary intake amount but is used only to show compliance with the permitted exposure level set on the basis of the toxicology. Frequently, the clearance then given includes a SpeciWc Migration Limit (SML) which, if all that is submitted is the three genotoxic stud- ies, will be 50 ppb. If more toxicology has been supplied and is satisfactory, the limit can be higher or lower but in no case can extraction be higher than the overall Euro- pean limit of 60 ppm from a package, and no SML can exceed that dictated by the toxicology data. The main point to be noted here is that the extraction information is used only to provide some assurance of compliance with the safety limit set on the basis of the toxicity data; dietary intake is not considered, nor is any market pene- tration factor.

The two systems obviously diVer dramatically in their conception. The United States system permits the user of a material to have reasonable certainty about its regula- tory acceptability if a material or substance is the subject of a Food Additive Regulation or a Pre-Market NotiW- cation. The European system clearly provides the end user with much less certainty for the reasons discussed below."}},

Implementing the methods of our framework in the practice of risk assessment, as well as scientific testing to validate our proposed methodology, will likely yield valuable information that will inform future work in this important area. Our framework builds upon international willingness and collaborative efforts to improve chemical risk assessment practice and in doing so is in- tended to further broaden the application of these efforts.

{"http://tableXtr.pdf/extractedFrom": "file:///Users/theobouganim/Desktop/Inria_work/RTP_PDF/Functional-assessment-of-sexual-maturity-in-male_2012_Regulatory-Toxicology-.pdf", "PDF_pmid_URI": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22579626", "content": {"CoiStatement": "The presence of sperm in the baseline semen samples was con- sistently associated with older and larger animals compared to those animals with sperm absent from the baseline semen sample (Tables 1 and 2). Interestingly, at termination, testis and seminal vesicle weights of animals with sperm present at baseline were also higher compared to those animals with sperm absent (Table 4). This observation suggests that the presence/absence of sperm in a semen sample is apparently associated with a different degree of maturation of the reproductive tract and underlines the relevance of the ability to obtain semen samples. Similar observations were reported for the African Green monkey (Chlorocebus aethiops (Bra- dy et al., 1985). In this study, in addition to body weight, animals without sperm in a semen sample also had lower testis size and testosterone levels. Interestingly, when sperm were present in a semen sample, testis size, and testosterone levels were in the range of adult animals. Body weight differences were also reported for pre- and post-spermarchial boys (Ji, 2001). This work demonstrates that the sole presence of sperm in a long-tailed macaque semen sample provided unequivocal evidence for sexual maturity. This is considered important since this obser- vation eliminates the need for complete semen analysis including ejaculate volume, sperm number, sperm motility, and sperm mor- phology. Quantitative semen analysis is challenging, can be highly variable within and between laboratories and mandates a quality control program (Cooper et al., 2002). Whereas collection of semen samples from macaques has not been a common approach previ- ously, it appears to be more widespread recently. Hence, obtaining a semen sample and checking for presence of sperm by simple light microscopy should enable a larger scale animal screening and may also be feasible for NHP breeding facilities. In the present work a difference in body and testicular growth rate between animals of Mauritian and Asian origin was encountered (Figs. 1 and 4 for de- tails). Overall, these baseline data suggest that Mauritian animals apparently grow faster and complete male reproductive tract mat- uration earlier than Asian animals. For the purpose of identifying sexually mature animals based upon age, body weight or testes size, the animal origin would be relevant. However, using the pres- ence of sperm in a semen sample as a functional endpoint would eliminate the need to consider the male long-tailed macaque origin. 5.

Interestingly, at termination, testis and seminal vesicle weights of animals with sperm present at baseline were also higher compared to those animals with sperm absent (Table 4). This observation suggests that the presence/absence of sperm in a semen sample is apparently associated with a different degree of maturation of the reproductive tract and underlines the relevance of the ability to obtain semen samples. Similar observations were reported for the African Green monkey (Chlorocebus aethiops (Bra- dy et al., 1985). In this study, in addition to body weight, animals without sperm in a semen sample also had lower testis size and testosterone levels. Interestingly, when sperm were present in a semen sample, testis size, and testosterone levels were in the range of adult animals. Body weight differences were also reported for pre- and post-spermarchial boys (Ji, 2001). This work demonstrates that the sole presence of sperm in a long-tailed macaque semen sample provided unequivocal evidence for sexual maturity. This is considered important since this obser- vation eliminates the need for complete semen analysis including ejaculate volume, sperm number, sperm motility, and sperm mor- phology. Quantitative semen analysis is challenging, can be highly variable within and between laboratories and mandates a quality control program (Cooper et al., 2002). Whereas collection of semen samples from macaques has not been a common approach previ- ously, it appears to be more widespread recently. Hence, obtaining a semen sample and checking for presence of sperm by simple light microscopy should enable a larger scale animal screening and may also be feasible for NHP breeding facilities. In the present work a difference in body and testicular growth rate between animals of Mauritian and Asian origin was encountered (Figs. 1 and 4 for de- tails). Overall, these baseline data suggest that Mauritian animals apparently grow faster and complete male reproductive tract mat- uration earlier than Asian animals. For the purpose of identifying sexually mature animals based upon age, body weight or testes size, the animal origin would be relevant. However, using the pres- ence of sperm in a semen sample as a functional endpoint would eliminate the need to consider the male long-tailed macaque origin. 5.

Part I: Heuristic\u201d) using the larger CPS-II data set to assess whether this second sim- ulation produced different results to inform fundamental design characteristics of a real-life prospective study. We believe that the heuristic performed similarly well in both the IWHS- and CPS-II-based simulations. No modification is suggested, and we have the added value that the method works equally well in men as in women. Our second aim was to investigate the impact of dif- ferent PSIM periods on the study design. Our results suggest that if short PSIM periods are used, then the conventional non-inferiority test (Hypothesis 3) is more logistically feasible (a more detailed explanation of this biphasic statistical approach is given in the Appendix). Hypothesis 3, however, has the major limitation of not including the all-important CS comparison. The most robust approach might be to use longer PSIM (and quit) periods (to opti- mize the chance of detecting an effect on LC risk) in conjunction with Hypothesis 2, since the use of Hypothesis 3 without reference to CS is clearly inadequate. As in our previous study (see \u2018\u2018Hypotheses and fundamental study design characteristics for evaluating potential reduced-risk tobacco products. Part I: Heuristic\u201d), we have demonstrated that PRRPs can be evaluated in prospective studies with logistically rea- sonable numbers of subjects and study durations, using published studies on smoking cessation as the benchmark for the design of the actual study to be performed. These estimates, whether based on the IWHS results or the CPS-II results, indicate that it is feasible, in terms of study duration and sample size, to clinically evaluate the LC risk-reducing potential of PRRPs. It is possible to use short PSIM periods, with the most appropriate statistical methodology depending on the duration of the PSIM (in the 2- to 10-year range). Altogether, the present findings might be particularly relevant to Section 911 (\u2018\u2018Modified Risk Products\u201d) of the recently enacted FSPTCA, which modifies the FDCA to give the FDA authority to reg- ulate tobacco products.

(1972a) reported that the addition of sulphites to feed causes chronic gastric lesions in rats at a dose equal to 144 mg SO2- equivalent/kg bw/day but the current study found no acute lesions at more than ten times that dose level. The current study therefore calls into question the reproducibility of those effects at the doses reported. These findings create uncertainty around the most rele- vant toxicological endpoint to establish a suitable health based guidance value (an ADI), which can only be overcome if a robust subchronic or chronic dietary study is undertaken, for which the current study may assist in the selection of appropriate doses.

Microarray technology has provided the means for a true holistic view of plant cell expres- sion profiles which can be useful for the evaluation of differences related to environmental factors as well as genetic background. Studies have shown that even within a multitude of data, minor significant changes can be discovered and confirmed. New sequencing strategies hold the promise for even higher accuracy and coverage of transcriptomics. A major challenge lies still in the biological interpretation of results. While transcriptomics may help with the analysis of novel foods, it is not yet a standard tool for risk assessors in food safety evaluation. The set-up of a well-controlled database with standardized (meta) data would be a good way to make maximal use of transcriptomics data for food safety evaluation. Furthermore, such a database would provide excellent data-mining opportunities for elucidation of biological pathways and networks, alone, or in combination with other \ufffdomics technologies.

AHCC-FD demonstrated a lack of mutagenic activity in the Ames assay and did not induce micronuclei in the bone marrow cells of ICR mice. The acute oral LD50 of AHCC-FD was determined to be greater than 12,500 mg/kg body weight. Toxic effects attrib- utable to AHCC-FD exposure were not observed at the low- and mid-dose level groups of the 90-day study whereas compound-re- lated histopathological changes in the limiting ridge of the stom- ach and in the liver of the high-dose group were noted. Therefore, the mid-dose tested, 3000 mg/kg body weight/day was considered to be the NOAEL for male and female rats. These funda- mental toxicology studies provide critical evidence in support of the safety of AHCC consumption.

Che et al. / Regulatory Toxicology and Pharmacology 71 (2015) 379\u2013387 in order to investigate the toxicity and the safety concerns of SR extract, and the results indicated a genotoxic and hepatotoxic potential. The results of the subchronic study in rats suggest that the no observed adverse effect level (NOAEL) for the SR extract was considered to be 10 mg/kg/d. Interestingly, previous studies (Shi et al., 2013; Guo et al., 2014) reported that oxymatrine, the active components of the SR extract, has a therapeutic effect in injured rats with diabetes or non-alcoholic fatty liver disease. Thus, our current results on the harmful effects of the SR extract in the liver of normal rats lead us to propose further research on the com- ponent(s) that may be responsible for the hepatotoxic properties of the SR extract.

Non-calcareous rocks in the Virginia Formation containing cordierite, biotite, muscovite, and quartz also indicate a temperature in the range of 500\u2013 700 \ufffdC at about 1000 bars (PH2O; Labotka et al., 1981). Temperatures in this order of magnitude are further indi- cated by the work of Perry and Bonnichsen (1966, p. 525), who suggested on the basis of oxygen-isotope frac- tionation in magnetite-quartz pairs that the maximum tem- perature attained by the iron-formation at the east end of the district near Dunka River was about 700\u2013750 \ufffdC. Min- eralogic zoning described by French (1968) indicated that metamorphic temperatures progressively decreased to the west in a general direction away from the present location of the contact with the Duluth Complex. He concluded that grunerite formed at temperatures below 400 \ufffdC, prob- ably in the range of 300\u2013400 \ufffdC (French, 1968, p. 87).

The safe development of nanotechnology is important to the US and global commerce. The FDA is in the position of needing sound principles and practices in the review of nanotechnology- based materials in order to maintain a high level of safety and acceptance of this or any other new technology. The difference in nanotechnology is the rapid pace of development, intense interest by the stakeholder community (manufacturers, consumers, elected representatives), and the need to coordinate the interest by many regulatory agencies through the NNI and other approaches world- wide. In response, the FDA has developed a multifaceted approach to nanotechnology. The FDA initiated a Nanotechnology Task Force in 2007 to address and generate a report on the \u2018\u2018emerging\u2019\u2019 field of nanotechnology in drugs and devices. This task force has become the focal point for agency-wide coordination on nanotechnology issues within the FDA. This has led to an intramural training program at the FDA providing regulatory scientists with informa- tion on the development and behavior of nanomaterials in biologi- cal systems. In addition, the FDA has hired many scientists with training in nanotechnology and nanomaterial-biological interac- tions to increase the knowledge of the Agency regulatory scientists in this ever-expanding area of materials development. The FDA has responded to data-gap needs by funding an intramural research program on nanomaterials, and has developed two core facilities to enable Agency scientists to have access to the analytical tools necessary to conduct research. The Agency has additionally participated in U.S. Government activities (e.g., NNI), is actively col- laborating with U.S. Government, academic, and international lab- oratories on the measurement, safety testing, and biological response to nanomaterials. These efforts have additionally led the FDA to work at the international level with regulatory agencies from other countries to compare strategies regarding the safe development and regulation of nanomaterial-based products. As a result of these efforts, the FDA has issued guidances to industry and regulatory statements regarding nanomaterial-based regulated products (see documents at http://www.fda.gov/ScienceResearch/ SpecialTopics/Nanotechnology/ucm301093.htm). This latter point emphasizes the need for a Global Summit on Regulatory Science and the key role this workshop can play in the responsible develop- ment of research directions to support regulatory agency guidances and policies on emerging technologies. The rapid pace of accumula- tion of scientific data on the development, characterization and bio- logical interaction of nanomaterials can be overwhelming. A venue is needed where fundamental information can be shared, future directions of research and data-gaps can be summarized, and approaches of individual countries on regulatory science research can be discussed. This international venue then facilitates discus- sion among the participating countries to wisely utilize limited resources. This is expected to be an outcome of the 2013 Global Summit on Regulatory Science on nanotechnology and the 2014 Global Summit on Regulatory Sciences, which will focus on bioin- formatics, to be held 21\u201322 August 2014 in Montreal, Canada. 4.

The Agency issues the GMP and CPP certificates for drug exports, though its inspection service falls under the Ministry of Health, as in Croatia. The Ministry is also responsible for withdrawing medicinal products or batches of products from the market. In agreement with the Minister respon- sible for health, or the Minister responsible for veterinary health where veterinary drugs are concerned, the Agency appoints several boards which include prominent external experts from universities and hospitals. These are boards for medicinal products, veterinary medicinal products, medical devices, clinical trials, safety of medi- cines and medical devices, homeopathic products, pharmacovigi- lance of veterinarian medicinal products, clinical trials of veterinarian medicinal products, traditional medicines, and radio- pharmaceuticals. In order to strengthen its institutional capacities, the Serbian Agency has made use of European Commission funding for a three-year twinning project with the French Agency for the Security of Health Products (Anita Filipovi\u0107 Suci\u0107SAPS). The law defines the national procedure for the issue of authorisation that has to be granted or rejected within a 210-day period. Pursuant to the new Act on Medicinal Products and Medical De- vices, which is currently under preparation, a fast track medicine approval procedure will be introduced for medicines of great inter- est for protecting public health and for those already approved in the centralised procedure before the EMA. Furthermore, the Agency can decide on unlimited validity of the decision based on the pharmacovigilance data for the period of 5 years from issuance of approval, thus implying that the documentation must be up- graded prior to such a decision. Data exclusivity has existed since November 2005, and a generic product may be authorised for 6 years from the first authorisation of the reference medicinal Table 1 Development of the Croatian legislation transposing the EU pharmaceutical legislation."}},

Schaefer, J.L. Myers / Regulatory Toxicology and Pharmacology 91 (2017) 124e141130 authors recommend that data reported in compliance with the principles of good laboratory practices (GLP) should have the highest grade of reliability. For relevance, as mentioned in TCEQ (2015) guidance, studies that contribute most significantly to the evidence integration and that identify adverse effects relevant to humans are selected as key studies. For example, inhalation expo- sure studies usually take precedence over oral exposure studies for deriving inhalation toxicity factors and, conversely, oral exposure studies typically take precedence over inhalation studies for deriving oral toxicity factors. In addition, in the absence of adequate human data, animal studies and adverse effects that are known or likely to be relevant to humans are preferred as key studies. Section 3.3.3.4, Section 3.4, and Figs. 3e1 of the TCEQ (2015) guidance depicts the main steps in evaluating the human relevance of an animal MOA to humans. Section 3.15 of TCEQ (2015) guidance provides considerations for chemicals that are limited in data. Table 7 should be used in conjunction with Table 5 (general criteria) to identify additional study quality and ROB scoring criteria when evaluating animal studies. An example of how these criteria were used in the development of toxicity factors for ethylene glycol can be found in Table A.10 of the Appendix."}},

It is also one where agreement between regulatory agencies is unlikely to ever be totally consistent. Nevertheless, the drugs chosen for pri- ority review status in Canada are reasonably consistent with the much larger number selected by the FDA. It is also important to note that Health Canada has halved the median approval time for priority review status drugs between 2000 and 2004 (when the value was substantially above the target performance standard) and 2010e2014, and that the range of approval times has narrowed significantly. Consequently, there is no apparent need for Health Canada to review its criteria for selecting drugs for priority review status.

However, these SSLs are back-calculated as compliance with the ar- senic groundwater maximum contaminant level (MCL) in force in the United States (US EPA, 1996a,b). There- fore, their calculation approach is conceptually differ- ent from the toxicological one (SF0, UR0) adopted in the case-study health risk assessment procedure. What is more, at present the US EPA is discussing the set- ting of a more stringent arsenic standard in drinking water (IWA, 2001), which consequently would theoret- ically imply lower groundwater-related SSLs. Finally, the critical comparison of the arsenic total soil concentrations of Table 1 with the \u201ctrigger level\u201d (triggering further site-specific investigations to ascer- tain whether soil contamination really implies a haz- ard) of the German Region Baden-Wu\u0308rttemberg cannot be immediately carried out. The trigger value of Table 7, protective either of \u201csoil-transfer to food plants\u201d path- way or of \u201csoil-transfer to fodder plants\u201d pathway, is in fact expressly referred to the arsenic mobile fraction in soil (ordinarily, NH4NO3 extraction). However, some comparative considerations are indirectly derivable, ac- cording to the calculation exercise outlined in Fig. 6. Assuming in fact (1) an indicative biomass production rate (BPR) of 2.0 kgDM m\u22122 y\u22121 (considered as de- fault value for the application of the multimedia trans- port and transformation GEOTOX model complement- ing McKone & Daniels \u201891: McKone and Layton, 1986), (2) a thickness of the upper soil layer (interested from plant uptake) of 0.25 m with bulk density 1.5 kgDM L\u22121 (both default values in the GEOTOX model: McKone and Layton, 1986), (3) the arsenic plant/soil partition- ing coefficient of 0.11 (McKone and Daniels, 1991), and (4) the typical human exposure duration of 70 years, the arsenic mobile phase limit of 0.14 mg kgDM\u22121 listed in Table 7 would correspond only to a theoretical trigger total soil level of about 3.4 mg kgDM\u22121. The previous calculation assumes indeed the fundamental hypothe- sis of complete uptake of the arsenic mobile phase by vegetation only. The arsenic total soil level estimated in Fig. 6 is substantially concordant (at least as mag- nitude order) with the arsenic total soil concentrations"}},

Especially so when the standards of measurement and relevance just mentioned are virtually the same as required for evi- dence admissible in federal courts under the 1993 Daubert opinion of the Supreme Court.17 An amendment of the Administrative Proce- dures Act in this direction would be desirable, to prevent a cardinal conflict of interest of regulators: namely the very costly overreach of claiming phantom hazards under the fiction of objectivity. With this in mind, as a practical solution in line with current federal rules of evidence, ethical and objective grounds for regula- tion would exist if the evidence for a risk or hazard can be certified under Daubert premises. If not, precautionary regulations leading to prohibitions or to minimal permitted exposures should be re- solved by transparent use and benefit considerations, and by reli- able evidence relevant to humans: acute and short term effects in humans or animals at appropriate doses, and reports from dili- gent epidemiologic studies.

Gio Batta Gori Bethesda, Maryland E-mail: gorigb@msn.com Editor-in-chief", "Funding": "Imagination may be the engine of cutting edge research, but could not ethically justify legally coercive orders and regulations. The same can be said, for instance, of the use of WoE in the regu- lation of putative endocrine disruptors on the basis of lab and ani- mal tests, doses and assumptions that have fictional relevance to humans.13 Similarly for distant and unknowable human carcino- genic conjectures that are forcibly assessed from bioassays in rats and mice: bioassays that are plagued by hopeless statistical incom- petence14, and that are based on irrational default assumptions con- trary to science and common sense, and obviously irrelevant to humans, rats or mice.15 Similarly still for the many regulations that increasingly use WoE approaches grounded on aleatory techniques such as mutagenicity tests, in silico and omics conjectures, and QSAR.16 Incidentally, cancer bioassays alone cost the US National Toxicology Program upward of $5 million apiece, while the European Union projects over 30,000 substances in need of testing. Ethical and funding questions ought to be raised against such extravagant expenditures for data that cannot warrant human relevance, and which anyhow are arbitrarily altered in the rulemaking process. Undeniably, the official set-up for unknowable and distant haz- ards in health and the environment is intentionally distorted to give the illusion that regulations are based on the sound evidence of science, when in fact such evidence does not exist. Legions of trained scientists have been compelled to adopt this illusion as a way of life. An illusion that has become the pretext to deny or grant permissions and to fine or jail people, when in reality those deci- sions are determined in the play of competing pressures from Con- gress, advocacies, the media, public anxieties, self-preservation instincts of regulators and the regulated; and by the inescapable need to allow the myriad substances, exposures, and environmen- tal interventions that enable what is being perceived as modern living standards. The smoke-screen of pseudo-science allows con- cealing these conflicts and pressures, and to create the illusion of regulations grounded on the impartial objectivity of science. Admittedly, this new approach would remain as incapable as the present hypocritical system in providing reassurances of no risk. However, it would not be deceptive, and would allow setting up a rational and effective sentinel by redirecting vast recovered funds into a systematic and pervasive program of epidemiologic surveillance of the general population, philosophically and empir- ically similar to what is now done for the post-market monitoring of medicines. The funding of biomedical and other productive re- search could benefit as well. More important still, the proposed changes would restore trust in the fairness of the social contract that free citizens of free societies implicitly expect.

Devel- opmental effects occurred for G/DIPE, G/TAME, and G/TBA at expo- sure levels greater than or equal to those that affected the dams. Thus the components in evaporative emissions from vapors of gas- oline or gasoline-oxygenate blends do not produce selective devel- opmental toxicity in rats. Indeed the minimal effects to the general health of the adult animals and fewer effects to prenatal develop- ment suggest that evaporative emissions of gasoline and gasoline/ oxygenate blends are not selective developmental toxicants and pose minimal risk to human prenatal development.

There were no statistically significant differences in the IgM antibody-forming cell response between animals exposed to these vapor condensates and their corresponding vehicle control group when evaluated either as specific activity (AFC/106 spleen cells) or as total spleen activity (AFC/spleen). (In the BGVC high dose group there was one animal which had an IgM AFC/106 value of 216 and an AFC/ spleen value of 123, which was considered a significant enough outlier that it was not included in the analysis. Furthermore, there was no significant difference in the trend analysis when evaluated by the Jonckheere\u2019s Test. The results from the AFC assay for the G/EtOH, G/ETBE, and G/ DIPE groups are summarized in Table 2. Dose related decreases in IgM antibody forming cell response to the T-dependent antigen sRBC, were observed in the G/EtOH, G/ETBE, and G/DIPE exposed groups when the data were evaluated as either specific activity or as total spleen activity. For both parameters, exposure produced a reduced response at all exposure levels, but only the high dose reached a level of statistical significance. The response of the high dose group was suppressed 85% and 63% for the G/EtOH and G/ DIPE groups, respectively, and 86% and 64% (G/EtOH v G/DIPE) when evaluated as total spleen activity. While the overall response of the DIPE animals was somewhat lower than had been observed in the past, the positive and negative control animal responses are consistent with the range of responses observed with the Sprague Dawley outbred strain of rats. Statistically significant decreases in IgM antibody forming cell response were observed at the mid and high doses in the G/ETBE exposed group (Table 2). When evaluated as specific activity, the responses of the mid and high dose groups were suppressed 76% and 72%, respectively, and 64% and 70% (mid v high) when eval- uated as total spleen activity. There was no significant difference in the trend analysis when evaluated by the Jonckheere\u2019s Test. As anticipated, the positive control, CPS, produced a significant decrease in both specific activity and total spleen cell activity when compared to the vehicle control animals (Tables 1 and 2). The results of both the positive and negative (vehicle) con- trols were consistent with the historical controls for the laboratory. 4. Conclusions and discussion Exposure of female Sprague Dawley rats to the gasoline vapor condensates BGVC, G/MTBE, G/TAME and G/TBA 6 h/day, 5 days/ week for 4 weeks did not result in alterations of the humoral immune response as evaluated in the IgM antibody-forming cell response to the T-dependent antigen sheep erythrocytes. There were no statistically significant effects on spleen weight, spleen cell number, or IgM antibody production when evaluated as either specific activity or as total spleen activity. Based on the immuno- logical parameters evaluated, under the experimental conditions of these studies, the four vapor condensates did not adversely affect the humoral immune response of the test animals. Further- more, the addition of MTBE, TAME or TBA did not affect the immune AFC response of gasoline vapor condensate alone. There was statistically significant depression of the humoral immune response for three of the vapor condensates: G/EtOH and G/DIPE at the 20,000 mg/m3 dose and G/ETBE at the 10,000 mg/m3 and 20,000 mg/m3 doses. Plaque forming cell assays conducted in rats following ethanol administered alone by the oral route have shown decreased antibody responses in sheep red blood cells (Loose et al., 1975; Razani-Boroujerdi et al., 1994). However the responses to ethanol have been somewhat contradic- tory and may depend on the age of the animal, amount of ethanol consumed, and nutritional composition of the administered diet (Loose et al., 1975; Razani-Boroujerdi et al., 1994). There are no peer-reviewed published studies suggesting either ETBE or DIPE are capable of causing immunotoxicity, including hypersensitivity responses. An unpublished evaluation of ETBE in the guinea pig minimization assay with induction via intradermal injection of a 10% solution, followed by challenge using an occluded patch with 100% ETBE, did not provoke any signs of cuta- neous sensitization (no positive controls were used in the study; European Chemicals Agency website). DIPE did not elicit a positive response in an unpublished laboratory study using the mouse local lymph node assay (European Chemicals Agency website). In conclusion, gasoline vapor condensates and condensates of gasoline mixed with MTBE, TAME and TBA were negative in the plaque assay indicating that, similar to gasoline vapor condensate alone, the addition of these additives do not affect rat humoral immunity. Gasoline mixed with EtOH, ETBE and DIPE elicited posi- tive responses thus suggesting that the addition of EtOH, ETBE, or DIPE does depress the rat humoral response as compared to the response from gasoline vapor condensate alone.

There were no statistically significant differences in the IgM antibody-forming cell response between animals exposed to these vapor condensates and their corresponding vehicle control group when evaluated either as specific activity (AFC/106 spleen cells) or as total spleen activity (AFC/spleen). (In the BGVC high dose group there was one animal which had an IgM AFC/106 value of 216 and an AFC/ spleen value of 123, which was considered a significant enough outlier that it was not included in the analysis. Furthermore, there was no significant difference in the trend analysis when evaluated by the Jonckheere\u2019s Test. The results from the AFC assay for the G/EtOH, G/ETBE, and G/ DIPE groups are summarized in Table 2. Dose related decreases in IgM antibody forming cell response to the T-dependent antigen sRBC, were observed in the G/EtOH, G/ETBE, and G/DIPE exposed groups when the data were evaluated as either specific activity or as total spleen activity. For both parameters, exposure produced a reduced response at all exposure levels, but only the high dose reached a level of statistical significance. The response of the high dose group was suppressed 85% and 63% for the G/EtOH and G/ DIPE groups, respectively, and 86% and 64% (G/EtOH v G/DIPE) when evaluated as total spleen activity. While the overall response of the DIPE animals was somewhat lower than had been observed in the past, the positive and negative control animal responses are consistent with the range of responses observed with the Sprague Dawley outbred strain of rats. Statistically significant decreases in IgM antibody forming cell response were observed at the mid and high doses in the G/ETBE exposed group (Table 2). When evaluated as specific activity, the responses of the mid and high dose groups were suppressed 76% and 72%, respectively, and 64% and 70% (mid v high) when eval- uated as total spleen activity. There was no significant difference in the trend analysis when evaluated by the Jonckheere\u2019s Test. As anticipated, the positive control, CPS, produced a significant decrease in both specific activity and total spleen cell activity when compared to the vehicle control animals (Tables 1 and 2). The results of both the positive and negative (vehicle) con- trols were consistent with the historical controls for the laboratory. 4. Conclusions and discussion Exposure of female Sprague Dawley rats to the gasoline vapor condensates BGVC, G/MTBE, G/TAME and G/TBA 6 h/day, 5 days/ week for 4 weeks did not result in alterations of the humoral immune response as evaluated in the IgM antibody-forming cell response to the T-dependent antigen sheep erythrocytes. There were no statistically significant effects on spleen weight, spleen cell number, or IgM antibody production when evaluated as either specific activity or as total spleen activity. Based on the immuno- logical parameters evaluated, under the experimental conditions of these studies, the four vapor condensates did not adversely affect the humoral immune response of the test animals. Further- more, the addition of MTBE, TAME or TBA did not affect the immune AFC response of gasoline vapor condensate alone. There was statistically significant depression of the humoral immune response for three of the vapor condensates: G/EtOH and G/DIPE at the 20,000 mg/m3 dose and G/ETBE at the 10,000 mg/m3 and 20,000 mg/m3 doses. Plaque forming cell assays conducted in rats following ethanol administered alone by the oral route have shown decreased antibody responses in sheep red blood cells (Loose et al., 1975; Razani-Boroujerdi et al., 1994). However the responses to ethanol have been somewhat contradic- tory and may depend on the age of the animal, amount of ethanol consumed, and nutritional composition of the administered diet (Loose et al., 1975; Razani-Boroujerdi et al., 1994). There are no peer-reviewed published studies suggesting either ETBE or DIPE are capable of causing immunotoxicity, including hypersensitivity responses. An unpublished evaluation of ETBE in the guinea pig minimization assay with induction via intradermal injection of a 10% solution, followed by challenge using an occluded patch with 100% ETBE, did not provoke any signs of cuta- neous sensitization (no positive controls were used in the study; European Chemicals Agency website). DIPE did not elicit a positive response in an unpublished laboratory study using the mouse local lymph node assay (European Chemicals Agency website). In conclusion, gasoline vapor condensates and condensates of gasoline mixed with MTBE, TAME and TBA were negative in the plaque assay indicating that, similar to gasoline vapor condensate alone, the addition of these additives do not affect rat humoral immunity. Gasoline mixed with EtOH, ETBE and DIPE elicited posi- tive responses thus suggesting that the addition of EtOH, ETBE, or DIPE does depress the rat humoral response as compared to the response from gasoline vapor condensate alone.

This is supported by an international agreement that there is rea- son to move in this direction, based on a general acceptance that EDCs present a risk to humans and the environment alike. Since the risk assessment of chemicals is an interaction between exper- imental scientists, risk assessors, regulators and industry, the suc- cess of the work towards improving the legislation for EDCs requires continued close cooperation between these groups.

Resistance to heat, whether mea- sured by functional or immunological detection methods, is not a biophysical feature of known allergens that is reliably associated with the clinical allergenicity. Furthermore, evaluating novel pro- teins relative to their immunodetection status by using animal polyclonal IgG antibodies has no proven correlation with allergen- icity. Despite the lack of added value to the allergenicity assess- ment, functional heat stability assays may inform the toxicology risk assessment because the potential exposure of the protein can be discussed relative to its function in a food or under other processed conditions.

Generally, the concentrations of these heavy metals in the lipsticks were not higher than the safe permissible limit of heavy metals in cosmetics, except the E4 brown lipsticks, which contained a high Pb concentration (15.44 mg kg\ufffd1) when compared to the Health Canada (Canada, 2012) permissible limit (10 ppm). The results in this study showed that there was no sig- nificant difference of cadmium and chromium content in the lip- sticks of different price categories. However, there was significant difference of lead content in the lipsticks of different price cate- gories. There was no significant chronic non-carcinogenic health risk due to the exposure to these heavy metals through the inges- tion of lipsticks. The HQ and HI for cadmium and chromium in all lipsticks were below 1. However, due to the limitation to acquire the RfD of lead in IRIS USEPA, HI for lead, cadmium, and chromium were not considered. The actual HI of mix contaminates could be higher than the value reported in this study.

GC induced liver injury is characterized by the hepatocellular pattern of injury and the metabolic type of an idiosyncratic reaction. However, the causal association between GC and liver injury is less strong than hitherto assumed by the pre- vious regulatory assessment due to poor data quality of some spontaneous cases, calling for replacement of the regulatory organ unspecific by the liver specific causality method in assessing as- sumed HILI cases as well as stricter pharmacovigilance strategies towards improvements of data quality. Toxicological studies are now warranted to elucidate the mechanism(s) of human GC hepa- totoxicity that creates concern in various European countries.

Furthermore, PWG members agreed that, based upon the absence of experimental re- sults that would implicate genotoxic mechanisms for the observed proliferative changes, it was likely that foci of atypical hyperplasia and adenomas in the control group resulted from regenerative pro- cesses associated with advanced CPN. In the 1800 ppm group, these proliferative changes also most likely resulted from ad- vanced CPN, but, because of the a2u-g nephropathy identified in a 4-week toxicity study, a combination of advanced CPN and low-grade a2u-g nephropathy could not be ruled out as interacting modes of action (Lock and Hard, 2010) in the high-dose (1800 ppm) male rats. Neither CPN in laboratory rats, or a2u-g nephropathy in male rats, have any known counterparts in humans (Baetcke et al., 1991; Hard et al., 2009). Therefore, it was the con- sensus of the PWG that mechanisms likely contributing to the for- mation of renal tubule adenomas in male rats exposed by inhalation to THF in the NTP 2-year carcinogenesis bioassay (NTP, 1998) posed no risk for humans.

Consistent with the Supreme Court's definition of 'feasibility', OSHA finds that it is feasible to measure worker exposures to a hazardous substance if achieving a reasonable degree of sensi- tivity and precision with sampling and analytical methods is 'capable of being done' \u2026 NIOSH concluded in its post-hearing comment that 'current methods of sampling and analysis for respirable crystalline silica have variability that is acceptable to demonstrate compliance with the proposed PEL and action level.' \u2026 Based on the record evidence reviewed in this section, OSHA finds that current methods to sample respirable dust and analyze samples for respirable crystalline silica by XRD and IR methods are capable of reliably measuring silica concentrations in the range of the final rule's PEL and action level. This finding is based on the following considerations: (1) Several sampling devices are available that conform to the ISO/CEN specification for particle-size selective samplers with a level of bias and ac- curacy deemed acceptable by international convention, and moving to the ISO/CEN convention will maintain continuity with past practice, (2) both the XRD and IR methods can mea- sure respirable crystalline silica with acceptable precision at amounts that would be collected by samplers when airborne concentrations are at or around the PEL and action level, and (3) laboratory proficiency data demonstrate that there is reasonable agreement between laboratories analyzing comparable samples most of the time.\u201d Thus, in OSHA's judgment, technology is sufficient to make reliable measurement of silica concentrations technically feasible. However, the results in Figs. 3 and 4 indicate that this potential for reliable measurement is often not yet achieved in practice, sug- gesting the possibility that more stringent requirements on labo- ratory performance might help to close the gap between what is possible and what is done today. More stringent statistical quality requirements may also be essential for obtaining more useful results. For example, instead of requiring only that laboratories come within three standard de- viations of the reference value on 75% or more of samples in at least 2 of 3 consecutive rounds, AIHA might adopt the NIOSH criterion that \u201cthe method must provide results that are within \u00b125% of the expected (\u201ctrue\u201d) values at least 95 times out of 100\u201d (Ashley, 2015). Such accuracy would require greatly reducing the variability shown in Figs. 3 and 4, where far more than 5% of results lie further than 25% away from the expected values (given by the regression curves). This might be accomplished either by having individual laboratories make greater use of quality control measures for RCS determinations or by modifying compliance determination rules to make greater use of averages of RCS values assessed by multiple laboratories, to adjust for the fact that average values are relatively reliable, but individual sample values are currently too variable to meet accuracy criteria such as NIOSH's. Our findings also have potentially important implications for monitoring and enforcement of the new (2016) OSHA limit of 0.05 mg/m3 and the new action level of 0.025 mg/m3. In general, as quantified in earlier studies (Cox et al., 2015), current laboratory procedures do not reliably quantify crystalline silica levels that differ by a factor of 2 (e.g., 0.10 vs. 0.05 mg/m3). Performance was not improved at lower exposure levels, suggesting that the infor- mation obtained from laboratories today is inadequate for moni- toring and enforcing compliance with the 0.10 mg/m3 PEL (Lee et al., 2016), and a fortiori for the new, lower PEL (Cox et al., 2015; Lee et al., 2016). In the current data set, relative variability of sample values around estimated true values increases at lower RCS concentrations, as indicated by the fact that the coefficient of variation decreases significantly with RCS concentration level (Pearson's correlation coefficient is \ufffd0.7; Spearman's rank corre- lation coefficient is \ufffd0.8, both being statistically significantly different from zero at the conventional 0.05 significance level). Our findings also have potentially important implications for monitoring and enforcement of the new (2016) OSHA limit of 0.05 mg/m3 and the new action level of 0.025 mg/m3. In general, as quantified in earlier studies (Cox et al., 2015), current laboratory procedures do not reliably quantify crystalline silica levels that differ by a factor of 2 (e.g., 0.10 vs. 0.05 mg/m3).

This paper has focused on exposure estimation, rather than on health effects. However, the observed high variability of exposure estimates raises the question for risk assessment of how substantial errors in exposure estimates affect estimated exposure-response relations used in determining standards to protect human health, especially for lung diseases with threshold-like nonlinearities in their exposure concentration-response curves (Cox, 2011). Rhomberg et al. (2011) study the effects of exposure measurement errors on such estimated exposure-response curves and note that \u201cthe degree of bias known to apply to actual studies is sufficient to produce a false linear result \u2026 The consequences of this could be great, as it could lead to a misallocation of resources towards reg- ulations that do not offer any benefit to public health.\u201d Their concern is that findings of elevated risks at relatively low exposure concentrations (e.g., at levels mandated in current or recent stan- dards) could arise from elevated exposures that were misclassified or mis-estimated as being much lower than their true values, leading to the appearance of substantial health risks at exposure levels that do not actually cause them. Whether this is the case for RCS remains to be determined, but the substantial rates of false negatives (i.e., exposures in excess of desired standards that are mis-estimated as being below them) in this study suggest that exposure measurement error is highly relevant for determining to what extent (if any) RCS concentrations that are truly at or below current and recent standards cause increased risks of disease. Until laboratory practices and/or statistical protocols for deter- mining compliance are radically improved to give demonstrably more accurate results, the current high prevalence of false-positive and false-negative conclusions about compliance implied by Fig. 4 of this study can be expected to inhibit effective allocation of re- sources to improve and protect worker health. Compliance with OSHA's recent 0.10 mg/m3 or the current 0.05 mg/m3 PEL cannot be determined reliably by all laboratories without substantial improvement in current analytical and statistical practices. Until these improvements are made and credibly demonstrated, enforcement activities that are based largely on random noise or error in laboratory results will provide neither incentives nor capability to continue reducing out-of-compliance levels of expo- sure that could threaten worker health.

It shows that over two thirds of the TSDs lack data or even comments about asthmatics and that experimental data from asthmatics are referred to for 15 chemicals only. A compari- son of the support documents for these 15 chemicals from 10 dif- ferent programs for setting of short-term values reveals that the literature searches are generally incomplete. The exclusion of asth- matics and/or exclusion of data on asthmatics in the development of guideline values for the general population may interfere with trustful and efficient risk and crisis management. Lack of data for asthmatics should be explicitly stated in the documentation. The available data on asthmatics experimentally exposed to irritant chemicals should be analyzed in depth, as they may strengthen the choice of a default UF for intraspecies variability in sensitivity to irritants.

The model does not ex- plain the observed increase in lung cancer risk in short-term quitters due to reverse causation, but still appears to estimate the half life (H) quite reliably as about 10 years, based on the sen- sitivity analyses conducted. Though there is some evidence of mis- fit to the model for some data blocks, this seems mainly due to unusual patterns of response difficult to fit with plausible models, or to different blocks showing differing shapes of the relationship. The main limitation of the model relates to the data to which it was fitted. Misclassification of smoking status is likely to produce bias, as is failure to update smoking habits during follow-up in prospec- tive studies, and failure to adjust for other indices of dose. Never- theless, the model characterizes the observed relationship of lung cancer to time quit more fully than previously attempted.

Becker et al. / Regulatory Toxicology and Pharmacology 90 (2017) 185e196 195 5. Note added in proof While this manuscript was undergoing peer review, Chiu et al. (2017) published \u201cUse of high-throughput in vitro toxicity screening data in cancer hazard evaluations by IARC Monograph Working Groups\u201d (ALTEX (online first, http://dx.doi.org/10.14573/ altex.1703231). Unlike the investigation we conducted, the Chiu et al. (2017) study did not include adjustment of ToxCast/Tox21 results for the activity burst phenomena. As shown in our analysis, lack of consideration of this burst effect (e.g., failure to account for cytotoxicity) leads to scientifically questionable, and at times, un- founded, conclusions. Furthermore, Chiu et al. (2017) did not evaluate the ability of HTS data to predict cancer classifications. Instead, Chiu and colleagues employed a case study approach that appears to essentially mirror the methodology used in the recent IARC Monographs; they relied on ToxPi evaluations for activity rankings, HTS activity hit frequencies and an expert judgment approach (without accompanying a priori science-based ground rules or systematic guidance) to integrate mechanistic data (including not only ToxCast/Tox21 data but apparently also results from other in vitro and in vivomechanistic studies). We recommend that readers carefully evaluate the strengths and limitations of our study, and those of Chiu et al. (2017) in determining the evidentiary value of HTS ToxCast/Tox21 results for informing decisions on po- tential carcinogenic risks of chemicals. Acknowledgments The authors thank N. Ryan, D.

Based on a recent chronic study in rats, the NTP concluded that there is \u201cclear ev- idence of carcinogenic activity\u201d of PFOA in male animals and \u201csome evidence of carcinogenic activity\u201d in female rats (NTP 2019c). At the time of the decision of the HBM-Commission these findings were still in the phase of public commenting and consultation. No HBM values will be derived for genotoxic carcinogens when there is no threshold for effects ((HBM-Commission, 2014). Against the background of limited indications of increased tumour incidences from a few epidemiological studies it is required to follow the development of scientific data, in particular with regard to tumour- promoting properties, to check whether re-assessment is required. 5. Recommendations for action Measurement values exceeding the HBM-II give reason for concern because health impairment may principally occur. However, health impairment will not necessarily result from such concentrations. Therefore, these exposed individuals should be offered environmental medical care or consultation, and, where appropriate, also long-term monitoring including follow-up measurements. Further exposure should be avoided immediately by eliminating specific sources of exposure, as far as these can be identified. Thus, the range of values exceeding the HBM-II value has to be regarded as a range requiring intervention (i.e. the HBM-II value has to be regarded as an intervention or action threshold level) (HBM-Commission, 2014). If the HBM-II value is found to be exceeded in first-time measure- ments of PFOA or PFOS concentrations in the blood, a control mea- surement should be carried out at first. Furthermore, it is recommended to identify and, if appropriate, consistently eliminate possible sources of PFOA/PFOS exposure of these exposed individuals. In addition to occupational sources of PFAS exposure, these may include, above all, the consumption of drinking water or food with elevated PFOA/PFOS levels (such as fish from contaminated waters), according to the current state of knowledge. At present, the HBM Commission does not see any reason for recommending the determination of clinical-chemical parameters in cases where the HBM-II value is exceeded to a moderate extent, when other risk factors or pre-existing conditions are absent. No attempts should be made to accelerate the excretion of the compounds, PFOA or PFOS, because there is insufficient medical justification, and appropriate methods are missing.

Based on a recent chronic study in rats, the NTP concluded that there is \u201cclear ev- idence of carcinogenic activity\u201d of PFOA in male animals and \u201csome evidence of carcinogenic activity\u201d in female rats (NTP 2019c). At the time of the decision of the HBM-Commission these findings were still in the phase of public commenting and consultation. No HBM values will be derived for genotoxic carcinogens when there is no threshold for effects ((HBM-Commission, 2014). Against the background of limited indications of increased tumour incidences from a few epidemiological studies it is required to follow the development of scientific data, in particular with regard to tumour- promoting properties, to check whether re-assessment is required. 5. Recommendations for action Measurement values exceeding the HBM-II give reason for concern because health impairment may principally occur. However, health impairment will not necessarily result from such concentrations. Therefore, these exposed individuals should be offered environmental medical care or consultation, and, where appropriate, also long-term monitoring including follow-up measurements. Further exposure should be avoided immediately by eliminating specific sources of exposure, as far as these can be identified. Thus, the range of values exceeding the HBM-II value has to be regarded as a range requiring intervention (i.e. the HBM-II value has to be regarded as an intervention or action threshold level) (HBM-Commission, 2014). If the HBM-II value is found to be exceeded in first-time measure- ments of PFOA or PFOS concentrations in the blood, a control mea- surement should be carried out at first. Furthermore, it is recommended to identify and, if appropriate, consistently eliminate possible sources of PFOA/PFOS exposure of these exposed individuals. In addition to occupational sources of PFAS exposure, these may include, above all, the consumption of drinking water or food with elevated PFOA/PFOS levels (such as fish from contaminated waters), according to the current state of knowledge. At present, the HBM Commission does not see any reason for recommending the determination of clinical-chemical parameters in cases where the HBM-II value is exceeded to a moderate extent, when other risk factors or pre-existing conditions are absent. No attempts should be made to accelerate the excretion of the compounds, PFOA or PFOS, because there is insufficient medical justification, and appropriate methods are missing.

In parallel, there has been an increasing focus on understanding and applying mode of action, internal dose assessment, and chemical-specific assessment factors in risk assessment (Boobis et al., 2006, 2008). Coupling human biomonitoring data with a dose\u2013response assess- ment based on internal and/or absorbed dose via use of a Biomon- itoring Equivalent (BE) provides an extremely powerful and scientifically robust approach to conducting a risk assessment (Hays and Aylward, 2009). Conducting chemical exposure and risk assessments using both of these advances is the next logical step in this progression and provides a pragmatic tool in the context of risk management as required by REACH and other imminent chem- ical regulations. 4.

Nevertheless, regardless of the absence of any proven risk, drinking water will always be a major focus of consumer concern because it is a basic necessity for human survival and is a direct route to the human body for micro- pollutants. It is, therefore, important that a number of residual uncertainties be further evaluated. These include: how to assess the human health risk of chronic exposures to mixtures of micropollutants that may include trace levels of pharmaceuticals; relative susceptibility of individuals, including debilitated or immunosuppressed populations; and the effectiveness of existing water treatment technologies in removing pharmaceutical residues. It is certain that due to the beneficial health effects and economic importance of human pharmaceuticals, the best available evidence should be used to fully evaluate any additional actions that may be required to reduce environmental burden as a result of perceived human health risks.

Measured concentrations are representative of a moment in time, whereas watershed models evaluate con- centrations over a wide range of conditions and can help to put measured concentrations in perspective. Thus, models such as GREAT-ER and PhATE can be useful tools for conducting risk assessments of APIs in surface water. The only data required to use these models in a conservative screening mode (i.e., no re- moval or depletion mechanisms) is the per capita use of the com- pound. The very good agreement between CBZ MECs and PECs provides a high degree of confidence in the models to provide a reasonable screening assessment of environmental concentra- tions. This confidence then allows model results for the metabo- lites, for which there are considerably fewer data points, to be used to provide at least a screening level of risk assessment. The considerable datasets provided here of both MECs and PECs, along with the ADI information, will allow more refined assess- ments to be carried out as additional data and understanding be- come available.

Resulting MOEs range from 178 to over 49,000 (Table 7).

These toxic- okinetic data include all phases of kinetics, from absorption (expressed as absorbed fraction during a required time-frame or absorption rate for both the starting route and route of interest) via distribution and biotransformation to excretion. The data requirements for kinetic parameters within the non-pharmaceuti- cal regulatory frameworks (such as industrial chemicals, consumer products, agrochemicals, biocides, cosmetics) are currently quite inconsistent. Within the agrochemical framework, data on oral and dermal absorption are one of the requirements on kinetics (EC, 2009b). However, as the data requirements for other frame- works do not consistently include such requirements, this will mean that defaults values will be used when a risk assessment using route-to-route extrapolation is needed. Conclusively, the present paper illustrates how reliable information on the extent of absorption of substances in the critical oral animal study as well as under relevant human exposure conditions (dermal and inhala- tion) can reduce uncertainties with respect to route-to-route extrapolation in human health risk assessment. Application of default values for absorption can result in gross over- or even underestimation of the human health risks. An underestimation of human health risk is undesirable from the viewpoint of safety assessment while an overestimation of the risk might lead to unnecessary concern and risk reduction measures and associated costs. Therefore, quantification of the absorption (by in vivo, in vitro or in silico methods), particularly for the (oral) starting route, is considered essential. Conflict of interest None.

As such, it represents an advancement of previous work because it provides a clear statement of the foundation upon which interpre- tations are made and proposes specific criteria for evaluating the status of the data used in the WoE evaluations. These improve- ments are necessary to satisfy many legitimate criticisms delin- eated by Krimsky (2005) and Weed (2005) and to ensure that WoE evaluations conducted under the US EPA\u2019s EDSP are objective, transparent, consistent, and scientifically reliable. Toward that end, the convening of consensus workshops should occur as soon as possible to begin the critical work of developing objective and transparent relevance weightings (WREL) for all of the Tier 1 ESB endpoints that will be used in making WoE determinations under the EDSP. Future publications are in development that will propose a starting point for these important deliberations regarding the WoE methodology for Tier 1 ESB endpoints.

Only for 62 of 127 (49%) aromatic amines with CASRNs toxicity data (including EU risk phrases) are publicly available (status 2009). It is evident that there is a major toxicity data gap for many of the aromatic amines that can be cleaved from the 470 textile azo dyes which we studied. Based on the toxicity database, 15 (potentially) carcinogenic and/or genotoxic sub- stances as well as 11 substances which may cause sensitization by skin contact could be identified. 105 azo dye parent compounds could be identified that can be cleaved to give one of those non- regulated aromatic amines. Inconsistencies exist between the reg- ulation of aromatic amines (as cleavage products from azo dyes) in clothing textiles, cosmetics and tattoos. In 17% of random samples of clothing textiles taken from retail outlets in the Canton Bern, one or more of 8 non-regulated aromatic amines of toxicological con- cern could be detected. The highest concentration was 622 mg/ kg. While a number of aromatic amines are prohibited in cosmet- ics, none of them are prohibited in the field of clothing textiles. Potentially carcinogenic, genotoxic, sensitizing substances are highly undesirable in consumers products with direct and prolonged skin contact. The REACH regulation, Annex XVII, and the corresponding Swiss regulation do not cover systematically aromatic amines as cleavage products from azo dyes in clothing textiles. This regulatory gap has to be filled in a systematic and consistent manner. Declaration of interest The authors declare that there is no conflict of interest.

Thirteen miRNAs with increase in time- or dose- dependency were identified. ROC analysis provided evidences that the performances of these candidate miRNAs were comparable to standard clinical chemistry parameters (i.e. serum Cr and BUN), suggesting these urinary miRNAs can be used as potential bio- markers for detecting of drug-induced AKI in rats. Furthermore, the putative function analysis showed that these differentially expressed miRNAs potentially targeted on many genes which were related to the regulation of metabolic process and signaling. These data will improve our understanding and prediction of toxicology processes induced by nephrotoxicants.

Therefore, for markets with the lowest toxicant/nicotine distribution, the practical mechanism for compliancewith limits is unclear. For example, with Australian products where NNN/nicotine levels were the lowest of the countries in the current survey, substitution by brands from other markets is unlikely to be a practical solution, and compliance with limits may rely upon the availability of a limited pool of low toxicant precursor tobaccos. The negative correlation between TSNA/nicotine and formal- dehyde/nicotine suggests that the simple framework of reducing each of the 9 toxicant/nicotine emissions from cigarettes may be more complex than previously considered, with the potential for unintended impact on emissions of other toxicants. The scope of this was examined by comparing the distribution of toxicant/ nicotine emissions across the four markets (Supplementary Fig. 2). With NNN/nicotine, the data shows significant commonality in values, other than the Australian products, which showed a lower distribution (but still with significant overlap) to the other three markets. In contrast, with formaldehyde/nicotine Australian prod- ucts (together with Brazilian products) showed wider distribution of values than the other two markets. Consequently, reductions in NNN/nicotine might be achievable in the Romanian and German markets by changing to an Australian product profile but at the cost of increased formaldehyde/nicotine, and consequent potential for failure against this limit. The consumer acceptability of these changes in product styles is also unclear. TobReg expressed the view that compliance to the levels mandated for NNN and NNK will be readily achievable through established blending and curing practices (WHO, 2008); however, the practical mechanisms by which this could be achieved, and their feasibility on national or global scales is unknown. As noted by Gray and Boyle (2004) \u201cthe international tobacco trade is compli- cated, often based on an auction system, and the introduction of nitrosamine assays on unmanufactured tobacco would be difficult. Certainly regulations could enforce a prohibition on manufacture and sale of high nitrosamine tobacco, but both import and export regulation would be required by many countries, and would need to be applied to tobacco as well as tobacco products.While all this is possible in theory, in practice it is likely that the developed coun- tries will protect themselves best and others probably not at all\u201d. 5. Conclusion Our study sampled products according to TobReg's proposals, and we measured the emissions of all available products from four countries with different product styles. The TobReg process of sampling and analysing all products on a market was found to be logistically challenging, and our experience suggests it may not be possible to achieve in practise unless products are sampled from manufacturing sites. When the TobReg model of market-specific limits are applied, 70%e80% of products sold in each of the four countries (Australia, Brazil, Germany and Romania) were found to be non-compliant with the toxicant limits, and thus would require substantial redesign to continue to be sold in the subsequent regulated market. Application of the second TobReg model of fixed limits (both \u2018International brands\u2019 or \u2018Canadian brands\u2019 set limits) resulted in, often substantial, increases in non-compliance rates both at an individual toxicant level and when applying multiple toxicant limits simultaneously. In some cases, all products on a market failed to meet the TobReg-provided limits. A third, recently proposed model, of setting limits based on three-times the lowest emission levels of products on a market, shows similar challenging results, with 68e99% non-compliances. This latter model is particularly sensitive to the impact of atypical products on a mar- ket, and may be challenged by analytical errors and emission levels too low to be quantified. Use of the market median to set toxicant limits is technically challenging to comply with: first, half of the products on themarket are automatically non-compliant; and second, when the likely measurement error is taken into account, compliance with the proposed limits is highly influenced by product and analytical variability for a large proportion of products. Use of the market median to set toxicant limits is technically challenging to comply with: first, half of the products on themarket are automatically non-compliant; and second, when the likely measurement error is taken into account, compliance with the proposed limits is highly influenced by product and analytical variability for a large proportion of products. Simultaneous application of all nine toxicant limits also con- tributes substantially to the high levels of non-compliance owing to the lack of close positive correlation between many toxicant emission levels. Evidence of negative correlation (between TSNAs and formaldehyde, or between 1,3-butadiene and NNN, NNK or formaldehyde) suggests that reducing yields of some toxicants would lead to an increase in yields of other toxicants. Very different limits for each toxicant were calculated across the four markets, with limits for TSNAs ranging more than threefold. Furthermore, regulating toxicant emission levels as a ratio to nicotine yields in- creases the complexity of the regulation and allows some products with relatively high toxicant emissions to register as compliant if their nicotine yields are also high.

A fundamental finding of our study is that each of the three TobReg proposed toxicant limit models go far beyond TobReg's aims of reducing toxicant levels in cigarette smoke whilst not eliminating the majority of cigarette brands in their current form from a market.

Ciprofloxacin may impact on the implanted flora sufficient- ly to decrease the antagonistic function of the microbiota. Despite the hypothesis of the VICH experts, both models seem to be equally appropriate for assessing the impact of antibiotics on the human intestinal flora. However, we agree that rat is the more commonly used species in toxicol- ogy studies.

(2015) determined that the day-to-day use of common analytical methods for RCS could not provide employers with reliably accurate data at the proposed OSHA PEL and action level. The results further suggested thatmany laboratories underestimate the silica concentrations, potentially resulting in a false indication of compliance reported to their clients. The immediate implications of our study are that laboratories using a muffle furnace preparation technique may produce results that are artificially low. While the cause for the bias may involve more factors that simply using a muffle furnace (as opposed to plasma ashing), the data do show a low recovery when muffle furnaces are used in the sample preparation. We recommend that muffle furnace preparation of silica samples be discontinued and that plasma ashing be used instead. We would caution, however, that there are many sources of variability which might result in unreliable results even with the plasma ashing at these low silica concentrations."}},

Fundamental changes in the near future are inevitable in both regulatory toxicology and basic science experiments. Regulations in biomedical research impose huge constraints and challenges for the laboratories, managements as well as scientists. There are huge regulatory issues, where scientific personnel have to provide adequate guarantees that protocols are followed adequately, and all the standards are maintained as per the SOPs and all the rules are adhered while implementing the study (Stephens et al., 2013).

The application of GLP standards can be of great benefit to the scientists of all the organizations, where protocols and SOPs can identify any shortcomings for a more successful research. The concept of GLP principles should be translated into basic as well as to applied scientific fields. Any successful experiment needs a good protocol writing, prior experimental design, characterization of test items under investigation, calibration and validation of analytical equipments as well as to record and preserve the experimental data in a most appropriate scientific way for future scrutinization and discussion.

A better understanding of what DAP\u2019s and other OP metabolites do and do not measure is critical to an informed discussion of what the available epidemiol- ogic studies actually tell us. In this regard, the discussion in a re- cent toxicological review of chlorpyrifos (Eaton et al., 2008) provides some useful (though chlorpyrifos specific) insight into the scope of the problem. Finally, significant disease-exposure associations cannot be used to validate an exposure metric. Indeed, poor exposure metrics are not a real obstacle to identifying significant associations be- tween exposure and disease. Austin et al. (2006), in an illustration of the hazards of data dredging, showed that, if enough diseases were considered, one could find associations between astrological sign and disease risk, while the review of Popcock et al. (2004) identifies a number of flaws in published studies which are likely to result in reporting of spurious associations. The problem is that DAP levels from the general population inevitably overstate OP exposures (Krieger et al., 2003), which might be erroneously taken to show that OP exposures are too high under existing regulations. Moreover, since residential DAP levels are not strongly related to actual OP exposure, but still provide a putative exposure metric, DAP levels can provide a basis for identifying spurious associations. Since DAP levels are an imperfect measure of exposures, some may argue that the true associations are even larger than reported (e.g., Bouchard et al., 2010). All of these considerations argue for a care- ful reconsideration of DAPs as useful biomarkers for estimating non-occupational OP exposure, except as qualitative indicators of changing use patterns. For example, Barr et al. (2011a,b) conclude that DAP levels since 2000 have dropped as a result of EPA\u2019s virtual elimination of residential OP use, and restrictions on crop registra- tions. However, only the dimethylthiophosphate, dimethyldithio- phosphate and diethyldithiophosphate have declined substantially, and the other 3 DAPs actually seem to have held steady. Specific chemical biomarkers e.g., OP alcohol moieties or \u2018\u2018leav- ing groups\u2019\u2019 and their utility in prospective occupational studies to reconstruct exposure has been demonstrated (Krieger and Dinoff, 2000; Bouchard et al., 2006), and advocated even in non-occupa- tional studies (Dong et al., 1996) when exposure to a specific OP can be described. However, measurement of the detoxication prod- ucts in urine, using specimens resulting from spot sampling proto- cols, without specific knowledge of insecticide exposure is insufficient to establish OP insecticide exposure. The results of such analyses may represent extreme exposure overestimates for aggregate or cumulative risk assessment since there is an uncer- tain, time-dependent relationship between biomarker concentra- tion in urine and parent OP insecticide exposures in environmental media, particularly diet. For OPs the use of spot ur- ine samples provides estimates that should typically fall within 2\u2013 4-fold of 24 h collections, since the half-life of DAP excretion is on the order of 8\u201312 h (Timchalk et al., 2007). Without specific knowledge of OP use or contact, the value of urine biomarker data is restricted to (a) qualitative identification of potentially exposed groups; (b) recognition of changing patterns of biomarker exposure with modified use practices such as the ces- sation of residential OP use or replacement of OPs by other classes of insecticides, and; (c) establishment of a working range of bio- marker levels for use in clinical medicine or occupational research to establish a relationship to AChE inhibition. The DAPs are now unjustifiably being used to represent non-dietary and environmen- tal exposures to OPs, with supporting documentation of use such as amount of OP used in a geographic area (McKone et al., 2007) or measureable levels of OPs in house dust (Thompson et al., 2008) or widespread urban use (Engel et al., 2007). Such ancillary information do not satisfy the criteria of exposure to a specific pes- ticide, but rather indicate that the OPs were used in some ill-de- fined proximity and timing to people. While co-occurrence of specific OP metabolites with DAPs may help to bolster the value of DAP measurements, the specific OP metabolites are also bio- available (Timchalk et al., 2007; Busby-Hjerpe et al., 2010; and Chen et al., 2012b), and co-exist at higher concentrations than the parent OP in environmental media (Morgan et al., 2005; Chen et al., 2012a). Thus, DAPs used as a surrogate for residential OP exposure are extremely biased by their high oral bioavailability and ubiquitous presence in food at concentrations several-fold greater than parent OPs. As a result, studies relying on DAPs as an indicator of OP exposure that lack credible information on prox- imate OP exposure are simply measuring DAP exposure and misat- tributing OP exposure.

A more detailed correlation of structural elements and toxicological potency in the subclass of halogenated but multifunctional compounds is needed to distinguish halogenated compounds of low, moderate and high toxicity reassignable to the Cramer scheme or alterna- tively applicable to category specific TTC values. For the derivation of the TTC values recent findings in ADME (absorption, distribution, metabolism and elimination) could also be included into a refined classification scheme. PBPK (Physiologi- cally Based PharmacoKinetic) modelling for example could be used to replace the default uncertainty factors for inter- and intraspecies differences with chemical specific toxicokinetic and/or toxicody- namic data, which will result in more specific TTC values. Further, the inclusion of metabolites in the three Cramer classes could also give valuable input for a possible refinement. Ideally study data on both the parent chemical and its main metabolites will indicate whether there is an increase or decrease in toxicity during the bio- transformation process in vivo. Recently the EFSA committee \u2018\u2018has considered the possibility that a genotoxic metabolite could be produced from a parent substance without any structural alert for genotoxicity. If such metabolites were to be predicted, then the TTC value of 0.15 lg/person per day should be applied\u2019\u2019 (EFSA, 2011).

We present an external evaluation of the committees after 12 years of functioning. It provides new information that could be helpful in the context of the European Directive (2001) for improving some dysfunctional prac- tices observed. It highlights crucial points, for example, the difficulty of uniting all the members in the sessions, of having an equal representation in the different groups, of regulating the number of dossiers treated, and of harmonizing the training of the members. Above all, it seems important that the committees acquire a sta- tus and financial means.

These animals do not need to undergo a full histopathological examination; only those organs specifically implicated in the positive tumor finding need to be examined. It is clear that this study design offers exactly the same power and Type 1 error control as design D3, but has greater robustness in the event of unexpectedly high toxicity, and provides compara- bly useful non-neoplastic data to design D1. On the other hand, when compared to design D3, the additional costs born by the sponsor are not trivial, but are not overwhelming. An extra 185 animals (of each sex and species) must be acquired, housed, mon- itored, dosed, sacrificed, and stored post-mortem. In addition, some of these animals (typically 145) might have to undergo par- tial histopathological examinations, although only in the event that data is found indicating a tumor effect, and even then only in those organs relevant to the tumor findings. This sort of contingent design seems likely to be the most cost-effective way to satisfy all of the competing demands for rodent carcinogenicity studies. 8. Conclusion The existing designs, in many important cases, deliver inade- quate levels of power, especially under the currently used joint test. If a study does not have the power to reliably detect effects of interest, then one can have little faith in negative findings. Rodent carcinogenicity studies therefore represent a waste of resources, both by the sponsors who must conduct these studies, and by the FDA which must review them. In addition, they may convey a false sense of security, leading regulators, physicians, and consumers alike to underestimate the cancer risk associated with drugs. The statistical decision process is only the first stage in the FDA\u2019s review process for rodent carcinogenicity studies, and so there is always the prospect that Type 1 and Type 2 errors may be overturned by the ECAC. However, the process lends itself to overturning Type 1 errors more than Type 2 errors. Consequently, low power is especially problematic in a way that a high false positive rate might not be. Compared with the existing designs, and under the CUJT, the new design D3 delivers both considerably superior power and comparable Type 1 error control. Changing to the PJT improves the power of the old designs more than that of D3, thus narrowing the gap, but D3 still outperforms the old designs by a wide margin in many scenarios of interest. Additionally, the old designs suffer from a greater inflation of the Type 1 error rate when switching from CUJT to PJT. It follows that D3 offers the best balance of Type 1 and Type 2 error, and is far preferable to the currently used designs, although the loss of information about pre-neoplastic lesions at the clinical dose level is not negligible. That said, it is important to note that there are cases of regula- tory interest (carcinogenicity models C2 and C4, for instance) where none of the designs delivered acceptable power. Of the currently used designs, D1 is considerably more conser- vative than D2, offering less power, but also a lower false positive rate. The current proposal to replace CUJT with PJT clearly has the potential to increase the power of the tests, although at the risk of increasing the false positive rate. The adoption of D3 would have a far greater effect on power. If the D3 were used in conjunction with CUJT, power would be substantially improved with little change in the false positive rate compared with D2 (although the false positive rate would be somewhat elevated compared with D1). This may be an appealing alternative to liberalizing the deci- sion rules For a single design to satisfy all of our goals for carcinogenicity bioassays requires additional animals, but in many cases these ani- mals need not undergo examination by a pathologist. The addi- tional cost of a design such as D3A is therefore likely to be considerably smaller than one that tries to address all our needs simply by adding more and larger dose groups.

Discussion Conclusion mk:H1_18 Acknowledgments 6 Abbreviations Funding body information References", "Compliance with ethical standards": "Current treatment of MDR-TB consists of drugs which induce fre- quent and severe toxic effects (Arbex et al., 2010; Koul et al., 2011), that are directly linked to patient non-compliance and may result in changes to the therapeutic regimen, usually with less effective drug options. Accumulating evidence from in vitro and in vivo studies show the efficacy of thioridazine against drug-resistance strains of M. tu- berculosis, and the combination of thioridazine with antibiotic regi- ments suggest the potential use of thioridazine as an adjunct to stan- dard chemotherapy of MDR-TB (Amaral et al., 2010a; Amaral and Viveiros, 2017; Dutta et al., 2014; Ordway et al., 2003; Viveiros and Amaral, 2001). Although long-term administration of thioridazine is limited by its toxicity, thioridazine has been successfully used in clinical trials. Therefore, this class of modified phenothiazines with limited indicators of toxicity should be considered in the development of therapeutic strategies or the potential use in combination treatment for MDR-TB. 5.

The major metabolic reactions included hydroxylation and formation of their corresponding glucuronide conjugates. Other important reaction was ester hydrolysis. Extensive conjugation occurred through glu- curonidation of phase I oxidation products in all species but with substantially higher proportions in dog (~90%). No major unique metabolites were observed in human hepatocytes. Benalaxyl did not exhibit enantioselective metabolism in rats or humans. Overall, the assessment from this study has been very useful and supports human risk assessment based on rat toxicology data.

Metabolism was complete within 24 h, with the majority occurring within the first 8 h. There were no clear dif- ferences in the rate or extent of metabolism of rebaudioside B, D, or M relative to the comparative control rebaudioside A. There were no apparent gender differences in the rate of metabolism of any of the rebaudiosides, regardless of the concentrations tested. Based on these data, it is concluded that rebaudiosides B, D, and M are metabolized to steviol in the same manner as rebaudioside A, and, therefore, support the use of toxicology data available on steviol, and on steviol glycosides metabolized to steviol (i.e., rebaudioside A) to substantiate the safety of rebaudiosides B, D, and M. 5.

Purkayastha et al. / Regulatory Toxicology and Pharmacology 72 (2015) 646\u2013657 was satisfactorily qualified and metabolism of the tested steviol glycosides to steviol was shown to be due to the activity of the human fecal homogenates without interference or confounding by matrix effects. The LC/MS analysis of the blank sample showed the presence of trace quantities of steviol in the fecal homogenates in the absence of any added steviol glycoside or steviol. This trace level of steviol was the result of trace level carry-over during LC/MS assay of ste- viol concentrations over a wide concentration range from a low concentration at 50 ng/mL to the highest concentration of 5000 ng/mL. Trace levels of steviol present occasionally at the 0 h incubation time and in the blank matrix sample have no bearing on the interpretation of the results since, in all cases, these concen- trations represent 61.0% of the theoretical maximum yield of ste- viol from the hydrolysis of the Rebs tested. The results of the comparative in vitro anaerobic metabolism by human fecal homogenates of the steviol glycosides Reb A and E fol- low a similar pattern to that which was reported previously by Purkayastha et al., (2014). The 0.2 mg/mL samples showed almost completely metabolized to steviol within 24 h, with the majority metabolized within 16 h. Of most importance, there were no sig- nificant differences in the extent of metabolism of Reb E compared to Reb A (i.e., both are metabolized completely to steviol as has been previously reported by Purkayastha et al., (2014) for Reb A, B, D, and M). Further, for the first time we show that there were no apparent gender and ethnicity differences in the metabolism of these Rebs. This finding validates the use of the safety data avail- able on stevioside and Reb A, as well as steviol itself, to demon- strate the safety of Reb E. A close inspection of the data presented in Tables 4 and 5 appears to suggest that the rate of metabolism of both Reb A and E are fairly comparable at both 2.0 mg/mL and 0.2 mg/mL. The findings in the present study corroborate the results of in vitro metabolism studies recently conducted by Purkayastha et al., (2014) and those previously conducted with stevioside and Reb A (Gardana et al., 2003; Koyama et al., 2003). Both Purkayastha et al. (2014) and Koyama et al. (2003) reported that purified steviol glycosides Rebs A, B, D, and M as well as a stevia mixture, enzymatically modified stevia, stevioside and Reb A, each at concentrations of 0.2 mg/mL, the same concentrations tested in the present study, were all completely degraded to steviol by human fecal homogenates (from 6 and 5 healthy donors, respec- tively) within 24 h. Koyama et al. (2003) also found that steviol at a concentration of 0.2 mg/mL was resistant to degradation when incubated for 24 h with human fecal homogenates. Likewise, Gardana et al. (2003) and Purkayastha et al., (2014) found that incubation of stevioside or Reb A in samples of mixed fecal bacteria from human volunteers resulted in complete hydrolysis to steviol within 10 and 24 h, respectively. Again, no degradation of steviol was observed (Gardana et al., 2003; Purkayastha et al., 2014). The results of our present study further confirm the stability of ste- viol in the presence of microflora from the human colon. For both stevioside and Reb A, Gardana et al. (2003) reported that steviol was only detected following 3\u20134 h of incubation. In our present study, for both Reb A and Reb E the rate of metabolism to steviol appeared slightly slower as significant amounts of this compound were found to have been metabolized to steviol within 8 h (see Tables 4\u20136). Steviolbioside, a metabolic intermediate of each of stevioside (analyzed in Gardana et al., 2003; Purkayastha et al., 2014) and of Reb E (analyzed in the present experiment) was reported to increase rapidly in concentration (peak 2\u20134 h) after incubation with human gut microflora, after which time it decreased rapidly to zero (Gardana et al., 2003; Purkayastha et al., 2014). The results from our present study indicate that while somewhat slower, this is still consistent with our finding that \ufffd80% of steviolbioside was converted to steviol following 16 h incubation with human fecal homogenates. This, along with the finding that Reb E is also rapidly degraded to steviol (near com- plete metabolism in 16\u201324 h), shows that Reb E is very rapidly degraded to steviolbioside which in turn is hydrolyzed rapidly to steviol. This is consistent with the known metabolism of steviol glycosides (Renwick and Tarka, 2008). In the present experiment, Rebs A, E, and steviolbioside were evaluated both at a concentra- tion of 0.2 mg/mL and 2.0 mg/mL, respectively. These data indicate similar, or just slightly lower, rates of hydrolysis to steviol at 2.0 mg/mL compared to 0.2 mg/mL. The metabolic yield of steviol from steviolbioside (Table 6), at least relative to Reb E, was lower than expected at a mean of about 80% following 16 or 24 h incubation. Since steviolbioside is a meta- bolic intermediate of Reb E in its hydrolysis to steviol, one would S. Purkayastha et al. / Regulatory Toxicology and Pharmacology 72 (2015) 646\u2013657 657 have expected the hydrolysis of steviolbioside to steviol to be at least as complete as that for Reb E. As can be seen from Table 6, for the first 8 h of incubation this in fact was true. The seeming lack of further hydrolysis of steviolbioside at 16 or 24 h incubation may have been due to the use of a higher dilution factor (80 for stevio- lbioside vs. 20 for Reb E) in the preparation of the incubation sam- ples from the stock solutions. As a result, slight variances in the preparation of the sample could have resulted in overestimation of the theoretical maximum yield of steviol (i.e., less steviolbioside present in the fecal homogenate than nominally calculated). Regardless, given that steviolbioside could be an intermediate hydrolysis product of each of Rebs A, B, D, and M, and noting their rapid metabolism to steviol, it follows that steviolbioside must also be rapidly hydrolyzed to steviol from Reb E. The in vitro metabolism of steviol glycosides in the presence of human fecal bacteria demonstrated in the current study, and in the studies of Koyama et al. (2003), Gardana et al. (2003), and Purkayastha et al., (2014) is similar to that previously reported in rats (Wingard et al., 1980), and as discussed by Purkayastha et al., (2014) in human fecal homogenates in vitro. Similar results were reported for the in vitro metabolism of Reb A and D (Nikiforov et al., 2013) using simulated gastric and intestinal fluids and these same authors also reported that these Rebs were exten- sively metabolized in the presence of rat cecal contents such that no detectable quantities were present after 90 min. Taken together, the data of Wingard et al. (1980) and Nikiforov et al. (2013) show that metabolism of steviol glycosides, and in particular Reb D, by colonic microflora is similar between rats and man. In summary, the in vitro incubation of Reb A and Reb E in the present study with human fecal homogenate samples resulted in their rapid hydrolysis to steviol. Metabolism of 0.2 mg/mL samples was nearly complete within 24 h, with the majority occurring within the first 16 h. There were no clear differences in the rate or extent of metabolism of Reb E relative to the comparative con- trol Reb A. There was no apparent gender or ethnic differences in the rate of metabolism of any of the Rebs, regardless of the concen- trations tested. These results parallel those reported for the in vitro metabolism of the Rebs A, B, D, and M reported previously by Purkayastha et al. (2014). Based on these data, it is concluded that Reb E is metabolized to steviol in the same manner as Reb A, B, D and M, and, therefore, support the use of toxicology data available on steviol, and on steviol glycosides metabolized to steviol (i.e., Reb A) to underpin the safety Rebs E, B, D, and M.

In the present study, the bundled SWCNTs with length from 1.3 lm to 18 lm (median = 4.8 lm) were administered to rats with a single or repeated (intermittent) instillation for induc- ing acute or subacute inflammatory responses. Our study design is considered to be suitable for observation of inflammatory response and/or DNA damage. In conclusion, the present findings showed that SWCNTs did not induce DNA damage in the lung cells of rats intratracheally instilled even at doses that elicited both acute and subacute inflammatory responses. These findings suggest that SWCNTs have no potential for genotoxicity in vivo. Conflict of interest statement The authors declare that they have no conflicts of interest.

The biochemical markers all were in the normal range of control ani- mals. Histopathological evaluation also confirmed the nontoxic nature of the extract as its administration showed no remarked changes in the tissue histology. Through our study, it has been established that AATB is nontoxic with an LD50 value greater than 2000mg/kg body weight.

Clearly, the incorrect data for leu- kemia in the original 1994 follow-up of the NCI cohort study cre- ated misleading evidence for an exposure\u2013response relationship between highest peak formaldehyde exposure and leukemia. Only the original (i.e., uncorrected) NCI cohort data were available in 2004 when the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC, 2006) reclassified formaldehyde as a known human carcinogen (Group 1) based on findings for NPC and to a lesser extent NCI\u2019s findings for leukemia reported by Hauptmann et al. (2003, To date, corrected estimates for solid cancer mortality risks including NPC have not been provided as an errata to the Ameri- can Journal of Epidemiology or reported anywhere else to our knowledge (Scott-Lichter and the Editorial Policy Committee, 2009). The dramatic attenuation in the exposure\u2013response rela- tionship for leukemia based on the corrected NCI cohort data that we report here underscores the importance of obtaining corrected estimates in order to reevaluate the exposure\u2013response relation- ship for NPC that was the rationale for the IARC decision to reclassify formaldehyde as a known human carcinogen (IARC, 2006). 3.

Based on incomplete Fig. 1. Exposure\u2013response relationship for highest ever peak formaldehyde exposure a original NCI data. for several reasons. First, several agencies have conducted recent reviews that have classified formaldehyde as a known human car- cinogen based in part on the results from the 2004 publication by Hauptmann et al. (Baan et al., 2009; Euler et al., 2009; National Academies Press, 2007; National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences National Institutes of Health, 2009; Schulte et al., 2006; SCOEL, 2008). Second, recently published meta-analyses and re- views (Bachand et al., 2010; Bosetti et al., 2008; Duhayon et al., 2008; Zhang et al., 2009) have included the original estimates for NPC mortality from the Hauptmann et al. (2004) study. Although these meta-analyses and reviews include other studies, the inaccu- rate results from the sizeable NCI cohort may have an impact on the evaluation of heterogeneity as well as the point estimates and precision of summary relative risks that likely influence the interpretation of evidence presented in these publications. In addi- tion, the authors of published meta-analyses and reviews are un- able to revise their findings in the absence of corrected relative risks for NPC mortality. The NCI cohort data compiled for the formaldehyde workers study group through 1994 was shared with several of us (G.M., A.Y., and Peter Morfeld.) with significant assistance from the NCI. These data were reanalyzed using alternative methods with results reported in two peer-reviewed papers published in this journal (Marsh and Youk, 2005; Marsh et al., 2007). The purpose of the reanalysis was to determine the robustness of the NCI finding for an associa- tion between occupational exposure to formaldehyde and mortal- ity from NPC. Setting aside the difference in conclusions arrived at by the reanalyses, these studies, as well as the reanalyses of lym- phohematopoietic malignancies (Marsh and Youk, 2004), are now based on incomplete data and would benefit from reanalyses using the corrected dataset. 4. Conclusion The correction of the results for solid cancers, in particular NPC, from Hauptmann et al. (2004) should be addressed without delay by the authors and the NCI, as this published study plays a crucial role in the assessment of human carcinogenicity from formalde- hyde exposure. We would like to inform readers about these issues and ask for a prompt corrigendum of the solid cancer publication by NCI (Hauptmann et al., 2004). 2.0\u20133.9 4.0+ aldehyde Exposure (ppm) d by IARC in 2004 lassification nd leukemia based on original, corrected and updated NCI data and reanalysis of 236 G.M.

Biologically based, multistage cancer models (Ellwein and Cohen, 1992; Moolgavkar and Luebeck, 1995) can simulate tumor probabilities from exposure to complete carcinogens, and combinations of initiators and promoters, but as a predictive tool such models require more data (e.g., the probabili- ties that cells will undergo mutations, cell proliferation, birth and death rates as functions of the carcinogen(s) of interest, etc.) than the ILCR approach used here. Thus, additional studies are needed to measure MCS chemical emissions, and to assess the toxicity and mechanisms of action of MCS chemicals. Furthermore, as with other complex chemical mixtures to which humans are exposed, more research is needed to develop better risk assessment meth- ods and models that account for the biological complexities of smoking-induced cancers.

Meanwhile, some anomalies were revealed and verified when applying the TobReg recommendation, such as a) the US blended cigarettes may be hardly detected as compliance products when ceiling is set by using median value of data set formed by flue-cured tobacco dominant market, and b) the low tar yielding brands determined under ISO regimen were more often than not above the nicotine ratio ceiling for vapor phase compounds. This study demonstrated that it is very important of taking measurement uncertainty into account for upper limits of toxicants setting, agreement of analytical tolerance, and compliance de- cisions with the specification.

The enhancement of autophagy could protect NHPrE1 cells from oxidative stress and apoptosis induced by PNP. These results suggest that autophagy in NHPrE1 cells is important for reducing PNP-induced detrimental effects and that enhancement of autophagy may provide the po- tential therapeutic strategies to mitigate PNP-induced damages to NHPrE1 cells.

The large temporal variability in only a 4\u20136 month time frame using the identical commercial products highlights the need for standardized analytical methods with established repeatability and reproducibility using certified reference standards for accuracy. Ideally, assay repeatability and reproducibility should be established through inter-laboratory studies, and laboratories should demonstrate, through proficiency testing, their capability to meet the established repeatability and reproducibility criteria for each standardized method. In our opinion, until capable laboratories use standardized assays with established repeatability, reproducibility and certified reference standards the resulting HPHC data will be unreliable for product comparisons or other decision making in regulatory science.

Placing existing methods in the context of their intended uses and documenting their inherent strengths and limitations provides the input to support decision-making and decreases the potential for misinterpretation of the outputs of existing hazard classification schemes. The analysis also serves as a base for the development of new user-specific hazard and risk characterization approaches that integrate elements of various existing systems to meet the needs of specific safety assessment applications. This work is intended as one step in the ongoing goal to develop improved methods for proactive assessment strategies for con- sumer exposure scenarios.

There is scope to develop the model further to analyse fragrance exposure in laundry and household cleaning products, especially given the multiple routes of exposure (dermal, oral residue ingestion and inhalation). Moreover, an important component missing in the model is the occurrence or presence probability of fragrance materials in the products, where it was assumed that the fragrance was always present; which is a highly conservative, unrealistic assumption. An understanding of the actual likelihood of a fragrance being present in product will lead to a more refined aggregate exposure estimate. Another broader issue that merits investigation is the applicability of short-term (in this case seven-day) diaries to assess infrequent exposures. This is somewhat highlighted by the fact that some modelling assump- tions were required to integrate data on monthly basis from the SUPERB survey to the seven-day structure of the Creme RIFM database. This issue has been addressed in the food domain, and this study may benefit from the application of similar techniques used to analyse short term dietary surveys (Slob, 2006). Further- more, the expansion of the habits and practices data to include more EU countries will lead to a more accurate representation of the wider EU population. Lastly, the addition of habits and practices data for subjects aged less than 18 will allow a modelling of exposure to young adults, with the possibility to extend to younger ages (<13 yrs).

Subtle immunotoxic effects of the drug are likely to be overlooked under such conditions. Furthermore, we have tested a biologic that is al- ready on the market and therefore not expected to be toxic in the therapeutic range applied in this study. However, we do believe that there is added value of safety assessment in a disease model for instance when safety parameters are not or only marginally influenced by the disease. An integrated study design early on in drug development will yield a pharmacological profile of a candi- date drug on which a decision can be based to pursue or discon- tinue its development. Such an approach has the potential to increase the efficiency of drug development and additionally re- duce the number of animals used in the development programme.

With regards to between- laboratory agreement, a higher inter-laboratory than within-labo- ratory variability in bioaccessibility results was observed for most metals and treatment conditions suggesting that, for the methods tested, the absolute bioaccessibility results in some biological flu- ids may not always be in line among different laboratories. There are a number of potential sources of variation that may have con- tributed to this outcome. The most reproducible results were typ- ically observed with shorter extraction times. The inter-laboratory exercise suggests that the degrees of freedom within the SOP need to be addressed to achieve better concordance in absolute metal releases. However, for hazard and risk assessment applications, the use of these methods to generate relative release data for read-across purposes or to calculate effective concentration of metals in alloys and other complex materials appears to be acceptable.

Toxicol. 79, 63\u201373.", "Compliance with ethical standards": "The REACH guidance does suggest that consideration of other existing standards is acceptable, but that if the methods in deriv- ing those standards differ from the DNEL method, adjustments must be made accordingly (ECHA, 2008b). Because there are so few IOELVs available for use under REACH, the DNEL method may be de rigeur for the large majority of chemicals undergoing the registration process. As a result, industry may be required to demonstrate compliance with much lower occupational limits than they are currently equipped to meet (e.g., monitoring meth- ods, engineering controls, etc.). While the DNEL is not intended to be a metric for compliance (like occupational exposure stan- dards are), companies must demonstrate that their workers are exposed at levels below the DNEL in order to be able to place their product or products on the European market. Therefore, in effect, the DNEL will supplant all other European standards for worker exposure. This could result in significant effort on the part of industry to demonstrate they can meet these new standards. 5. Conclusions As the registration process for REACH gets underway, the imple- mentation of the REACH guidance for determining DNELs will be put into practice. The purpose of this work was not to provide final DNELs for styrene, but rather to develop DNELs for a chemical with a robust dataset to demonstrate how the method works and what the ultimate outcome is in relation to similar already-existing stan- dards. As this exercise shows, the method prescribed in the guid- ance generally results in more conservative screening criteria values than currently exist, especially with respect to worker DNELs. The impact that this new regulation may have on industry with respect to demonstrating safe conditions for their workers has the potential to be substantial.", "Acknowledgement": "M.L. Kreider, E.

Consistent with this hypothesis is the finding that the BMDL of proliferation and the POD of acute pulmonary irritation yielded essentially identical threshold val- ues. The concatenation of multiple events that may become chronically operative with excessive pulmonary irritation require chronic inhalation bioassays to be performed at meaningful mul- tiples of the acute irritation threshold C \ufffd Tday. Accordingly, MoA- based short-term bioassays, in conjunction with computational toxicology, are considered to be invaluable adjuncts to standard hazard characterization bioassay and the ensuing risk assessment process.

Competing interests All authors are current employees of Altria Client Services. 3 Results 4 Discussion Funding Competing interests Acknowledgment References", "Funding": "Intra-subject variability has been used to define the bioequiva- lence criteria for pharmaceuticals with confidence interval deter- mined by the intra-subject variability and the number of subjects in bioequivalence studies (FDA, 2003). Based on the FDA guidance, bioequivalence is established if the confidence interval for the test product is within \ufffd20% to +25% of the reference product. For drugs with highly variable pharmacokinetics (defined by intra-subject variability >30%), the criteria for comparison between test and ref- erence product can be extended beyond the normal bioequivalence limit. In the recently issued guidance on demonstrating substantial equivalence for tobacco products (FDA, 2011a), the Center for To- bacco Products at FDA has stated \u2018\u2018a new tobacco product is sub- stantially equivalent to a predicate tobacco product if the new product has the same characteristics as a predicate tobacco prod- uct\u2019\u2019. This guidance also mentioned that \u2018\u2018FDA may request addi- tional data needed to make a substantial equivalence determination. Examples of additional data that may be requested include: Clinical data \u2013 data comparing the biomarkers of expo- sure. . .\u2019\u2019. In the guidance, FDA recommends reporting 95% confi- dence intervals (a statistics related to intra- and inter- individual variability) for individual smoke constituents. FDA has also pro- vided additional information by issuing responses to frequently asked questions about the guidance (FDA, 2011b). Therefore, it is reasonable to believe that similar information may be required for a biomarker such as NE. Furthermore, for smoke constituents like nicotine, the relatively larger variability observed in humans should be considered when demonstrating equivalence based on machine derived yields of smoke constituents. Recently, there have been recommendations that FDA should impose product standards on the nicotine levels in cigarettes (Hatsukami et al., 2011). We be- lieve that the information regarding intra-individual and inter- individual variability in nicotine and plasma cotinine would be important to consider.

Exposure assessment studies separately conducted and reported as part of compliance with the 211(b) rule (Zielinska et al., 2012), demonstrate a wide margin of safety between various high-end exposure scenarios and the no observed adverse effect levels (NOAEL) demonstrated in the hazard screen- ing studies reported in this issue. In addition, post-1994 fuel and vehicle regulations have continued to decrease exposure to gasoline vapor and exhaust emissions (e.g. reduced vapor pressure, sulfur, and benzene in the fuel; on-board refueling vapor canisters in cars; strict specifications on portable gas cans; more stringent tailpipe emission standards, etc.). The final article in this issue, \u2018\u2018Gasoline Risk Management: A Compendium of Regulations, Standards, and Industry Practices\u2019\u2019 (Swick et al., 2014b), summa- rizes those regulations which provide the U.S. federal government extensive authority to regulate the entire gasoline lifecycle\u2014from manufacture, through distribution, to end-use\u2014all of which are subject to detailed, complex, and overlapping regulatory schemes intended to protect human health, welfare, and the environment. The article also describes the broad array of voluntary standards and best management practices implemented by industry to ensure that risks from gasoline manufacturing, distribution, and use are minimized. For those interested in additional detail on the 211(b) rule, the appendix to this supplement, \u2018\u2018Alternative Tier 2 Health Effects Testing Requirements for Gasoline and Oxygenated Gasolines\u2019\u2019 describes the events and expert analyses leading up to the development of the rule, the tiered structure of the requirements, what specific testing was required, and the overall objectives of the program.

There- fore, the FG72 soybean can be considered as safe as its non-GM counterpart with regards to allergenicity. In order to better inter- pret this type of data in the context of safety assessment of the allergenic potential of GM soybeans, future research should be con- ducted to appreciate the biological variability of endogenous soy- bean allergens in different varieties grown in different environmental conditions. Moreover, the correlation between the level of allergens and the allergenic potential of soybean should be further explored. Overall, the results have to be interpreted by using a weight-of-evidence approach in accord with the Codex alimentarius recommendations.

The diapers were purchased and the contents of the seven phthalates were determined and estimated amounts of exposure were calculated based on the eluted rate into artificial medium of urine or sweat, average weight of infants, and frequency of use. Di- 2-ethylhexyl phthalate and di-n-butyl phthalate were detected in the topsheets and determined to be 0.6 mg/g and 0.2 mg/g, respec- tively. The daily estimated exposure volume was calculated to be in the range of 1.86 \ufffd 10\ufffd10e2.98 \ufffd 10\ufffd6 mg/kg/day. For hazard assessment, we used 0.2e300 mg/kg/day for the seven phthalates based on the data available at international agencies. The margin of exposure to the seven phthalates was 6.71 \ufffd 104e1.99 \ufffd 1011, indicating that the risk of exposure to phthalates from the diapers produced in Japan was negligible.

The rejection of some of the proposed biosimilars was mainly due to non-compliance with quality, non-clinical, and or clinical requirements for these prod- ucts. Rituximab, one of the trastuzumab product, etanercept, and bev- acizumab were rejected mainly due to the lack of robust comparative analytical studies with the reference product such as proper binding studies and physicochemical characterization. A second trastuzumab competed with another trastuzumab biosimilar for the third slot in the box of 3 and lost the competition. Enoxaparin products lacked the necessary pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic studies (phase I clinical studies) in comparison with the reference product and were rejected mainly due to this reason in addition to other gap in the quality profile of some of them. Most of somatropin and rh-insulin products had limited and flawed non-inferiority phase III clinical studies, which are usually unnecessary for some types of biosimilar products like insulins, but lacked the critical phase I clinical studies. Finally, rh-FVII-proposed biosimilar to the Iraqi NRA appeared to be developed without any comparison with the reference product, NovoSeven, but only developed on a poor standalone basis. Another advantage would be increase patients access to current and future biological products for treating many life-threatening and disabling diseases, especially in the field of oncology and rheumatology. After forming BBRodeina Challand and putting forth the first Iraqi biosimilar basis and guidelines, pharmaceutical companies, both biosimilar and originator companies (some of them own both arms, like Pfizer with its subsidiaries and Amgen), were encouraged to hold more conferences and workshops. As outcomes to these activities and the continuous discussions with all biosimilars stakeholders in Iraq, physicians\u2019 awareness of new protocols comprising biologics would increase and reliance on old disease treat- ment protocols should be reduced.", "Acknowledgement": "Acknowledgements The authors are thankful to pharmacists Mowrooj H.

For the past two decades, a significant effort has been dedi- cated to developing alternatives to laboratory testing, including computational toxicology methods in the areas of hazard identifica- tion, toxicity evaluation, and risk characterization. Many refined and validated models exist for single chemicals and, combined with traditional methods, they help to improve the risk assessment pro- cess. In this paper, we wanted to demonstrate the importance of an in silico method as a tool that can supplement traditional ap- proach to risk assessment of chemical mixtures. In addition, identi- fication of susceptibility genes provides an opportunity to protect sensitive individuals and populations based on scientific knowledge as opposed to application of traditional generic default uncertainty factors for inter-individual differences. Introducing these concepts into evaluations of joint toxicity of chemicals is a vital step forward in our approach to mixtures. Future risk assessments will become more meaningful and greatly contribute to the health of the environ- ment and human populations as we increase our predictive capabil- ities and integrate the in-put of computational methods into the overall recommendations of the chemical risk assessment process.

De Schaepdrijver et al. (2008) PND, post-natal days; PNW, post-natal weeks. 298 P. Baldrick / Regulatory Toxicology and Pharmacology 57 (2010) 291\u2013299 6. Conclusion We know that toxicology studies can be conducted in very young animals, although there is still a limited database of informa- tion in this age group. However, a key question is, do they investi- gate findings that cannot be adequately and safely assessed in pediatric clinical trials, examine toxicity not covered in adult stud- ies (toxicology as well as pharmacology and kinetic evaluation), investigate added parameters for safety evaluation in pediatric work or help with drug product labeling? Even if the answer is lar- gely no, it could be argued that a lack of new findings in a juvenile animal toxicology study is a positive result in that it confirms a lack of increased sensitivity for young children to the drug being tested. Other authors have also questioned the need for \u2018\u2018inappropriate or unnecessary studies being performed or the inclusion of parame- ters, which generate little or no useful information\u201d (De Schaepdrij- ver et al., 2008) or the \u2018\u2018performance of complex, inappropriate or unnecessary studies or in the inclusion of complex parameters that generate little or no new useful data\u201d (Bailey and Marien, 2009). The \u2018\u2018case-by-case\u201d approach for juvenile animal studies has been en- dorsed in a recent publication (Cappon et al., 2009). While it is true that the results of the recent limited assessment of 39 juvenile animal studies mentioned earlier reported novel tox- icity in 4 cases, it is currently not clear if there are many (or genu- inely any?) clear examples when juvenile animal toxicology studies have accurately predicted novel human toxicities that would have an impact in pediatric medicine. However, in one area at least (CNS active drugs that have prolonged use in a pediatric population), experience has shown that regulators still seem con- vinced that neurobehavioral assessment in animals treated from an early age has some utility in assessing safety in young humans. There is also the issue of how to actually interpret study findings (especially if different-from-adult data) as it may be that the majority of different \u2018\u2018toxicities\u201d between adults vs juveniles are related purely to immaturity (e.g., through different kinetics). In- deed, this could have been the case for the 4 previously mentioned novel toxicities. From a kinetic perspective, if there is a real con- cern for a safe starting dose in a pediatric clinical study (that can- not be answered from extrapolation from adult data), there may be a need to examine for potential exposure differences in limited pharmacokinetic evaluation in a juvenile animal or perhaps from toxicokinetic assessment in a toxicology study with a reduced study design. Despite these reservations, regulators are continuing to request juvenile animal studies. Indeed, as mentioned earlier they have deemed that at least 45 of these studies (although it is not known how many were suggested by the regulators vs applicant compa- nies themselves) for a range of drug classes (including 4 biological drugs) were necessary to support pediatric drug development in Europe over the last few years. Even if all these studies are indeed needed due to safety concerns, the reported drift from a \u2018\u2018case-by- case\u201d approach to a \u2018\u2018standard design\u201d one within both regulatory agencies and industry (Bailey and Marien, 2009; Cappon et al., 2009) is worrying. The challenge is convincing fellow scientists/ regulators that toxicology studies in juvenile animals should only be performed if strictly needed and \u2018\u2018push-back\u201d to regulators for requested work (if not felt fully justified) needs to occur. Animal use (especially in puppies or young monkeys) with no clear goal for risk assessment is totally unacceptable. Current guidelines indicate a need for juvenile animal studies only when previous animal and human safety data are judged insufficient. This paper concludes that (based on available knowl- edge) there are currently not enough clear-cut examples to answer the question of whether juvenile animal toxicology studies to sup- port pediatric development are truly useful or necessary. Maybe as more data become available and are published, this situation will change. References Allais, L., Condevaux, F., Fant, P., Barrow, P.C., 2009. Juvenile toxicity of cyclosporine in the rat.

References", "Compliance with ethical standards": "The ability of ketones to serve as an alternative energy source is of particular importance in the brain as they supply nearly two- thirds of the energy required during periods of prolonged fasting and starvation (Laffel, 1999). The ketone monoester was found to enhance cognitive function following exercise to exhaustion in rats, as measured by performance in a maze task (unpublished data). Similarly, administration of a ketogenic diet improved cogni- tive function, as measured by performance in the T-maze and ob- ject recognition tests, in aged rats under both normoxic and hypoxic conditions (Xu et al., 2010). The higher metabolic effi- ciency of ketones compared to glucose has also been shown to re- sult in increased hydraulic efficiency in an isolated, perfused rat heart (Kashiwaya et al., 1994; Sato et al., 1995). So the ketone monoester may be used to enhance cognitive function and physical performance, particularly in athletes performing strenuous exer- cise. Induction of a mild hyperketonemic state has been proposed to be beneficial in a number of diseases, particularly those involv- ing insulin resistance or insufficiency of metabolic substrates, as well as those resulting from free radical damage or hypoxia (re- viewed in Veech (2004)). Elevations of ketone levels can be achieved through administration of the classic ketogenic diet con- taining high fat and low carbohydrate. However, such diets are unpalatable, so have poor compliance, and may increase blood cholesterol and triglycerides, which are well documented athero- genic risk factors (McPherson and McEneny, 2011). The ketone monoester may provide an alternative method of elevating ketone levels without the adverse effects of ketogenic diets. In summary, the pharmacokinetic properties and safety of a synthetic ketone monoester was evaluated in healthy adult hu- mans. The ketone monoester was completely hydrolyzed to its components (D-b-hydroxybutyrate and R-1,3-butanediol), result- ing in increased plasma levels of the ketones, D-b-hydroxybutyrate and acetoacetate.

There were relationships between the application levels of menthol and the perceived intensity of the sensory attributes \u2018strength of menthol taste\u2019, and \u2018cooling\u2019 effect. However, we did not see marked menthol-induced reductions in perceived irritation or marked menthol-induced increases in tar and nicotine MLEs. Thus our data does not support the notion of a menthol induced increase in mouth level exposure to tar and nic- otine, or a menthol induced reduction in the levels of mouth and throat irritation produced by cigarette smoke.

{"http://tableXtr.pdf/extractedFrom": "file:///Users/theobouganim/Desktop/Inria_work/RTP_PDF/Lead-exposure--lead-poisoning--and-lead-regulato_2006_Regulatory-Toxicology-.pdf", "PDF_pmid_URI": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16782249", "content": {"Compliance with ethical standards": "Judging by the lead exposure levels and the lead poison- ing rates, the current overall occupational health monitoring system appears inadequate, lacking the necessary enforce- ment power. In many situations, Wnancial penalties for vio- lations or non-compliance were not severe enough. Stringent enforcement is a vital part of regulation. A case in point is the recent enforcement of the regulation of occupational exposure to benzene in China. Because of some highly publi- cized benzene poisoning cases in the press, benzene, unlike any other chemicals, in recent years received much attention from the public and the government in China. In March 2002, an investigation initiated by the press discovered a cluster of 17 benzene poisoning cases among workers at a small make-shift leather bag shop in Heibei Province, where benzene measurements as high as 2040 mg/m3 were reported (Zhang et al., 2002; Wong, 2003,a). Five of the 17 cases sub- sequently died. The news outraged the public and shocked the government. Between May 2002 and January 2003, spe- cial control programs for benzene exposure were imple- mented (Zhang et al., 2002). Penalties were imposed on factories that were not in compliance with the national stan- dard. In some cases, premises were ordered to close. In the case of benzene, stringent enforcement of regulation came as a result of public attention. Unfortunately, unlike benzene, lead, and other industrial chemicals have not received simi- lar attention and no special control or monitoring programs have been established. In conclusion, as demonstrated by the lead exposure data reported in the Chinese medical journals, the 2002 Act, with- out the necessary enforcement, did not appear to have a major impact on lead exposures in the workplaces in China. Much work in enforcing the 2002 Act remains to be done."}},

Also for products where the risk/ benefit balance was favourable despite an environmental risk, the use or subsequent emission of residues necessi- tates regulatory consent. For example, for the use of Slice (containing emamectin) in the UK it will be neces- sary to obtain consents from the local environmental authorities (Anon, 2003). No-spreading zones for man- ure are already Good Agricultural Practice in some Member States, for example in the UK (DEFRA, 2002). Alternative solutions to the use of precautions in the product information may thus be found in estab- lishing precautions in permits, or in codes of Good Agri- cultural Practices, issued in these frameworks (Van Rijswick, 2003). Inevitably, the scientific and juridical underpinning of the precautions in these frameworks should be as meticulous as in the framework of registra- tion, and will also require a flexible risk assessment methodology to quantify the impact of temporal and spatial differentiation of residue emissions.

Furthermore quanti- tative and qualitative characterizations of by-products, such as fullerenic soot and carbon nanotube fibres, as well as their fate could not be exhaustively described.

This proba- bilistic approach is used to identify human exposure thresholds below which the risk of toxicological concern is low by taking into account oral/dermal absorption of the compound (internal expo- sure) rather than external exposure (Partosch et al., 2015). For completeness, decisions relating to internal exposure following oral/dermal administration should include considerations of metabolism. Indeed, when one wants to omit the determination of a NOA(E)L-value it is important to consider the possibility of metabolic activation, since the metabolites formed could be more toxic than the original mother molecule. An additional safety factor could then be added whenever considered to be necessary. Several in vitro and in silico models are available for predicting metabolism following oral exposure and there is increasing interest in the area of skinmetabolism for whichmodels are currently being developed (as reviewed recently by Dumont et al., 2015). Though in the cosmetic sector the TTC concept has been accepted for the safety assessment of impurities for which the identity is known but toxicity data are lacking (Kroes et al., 2007; SCCS/1564/15), more evidence is still needed to prove the applicability of the internal TTC for cosmetic ingredients.

Results of this study point to the utility of an abbreviated, CPD dose-responsive, non-invasive biomarker list, where the need justifies. For example, for conventional tobacco-burning cigarettes, some of the most CPDR dose-responsive biomarkers are exhaled breath carbon mon- oxide, 24-h urine nicotine equivalents, blood COHb, heart rate, daily MLE, and urine mutagenicity. This study also suggests that a one-week reduction/cessation design is an appropriate tool for characterizing exposure reductions when smokers switch from cigarettes to smokeless tobacco or to new tobacco products such as e-cigarettes or dissolvable tobacco products.

It describes the effects of various risk management options on contamination levels and the quantities consumed, and highlights the fact that pro- viding advice on food consumption is more efficient than fixing more restrictive guideline levels for methyl mer- cury in fish. We also point out the need to refine our exposure models to ensure greater accuracy regarding the major dietary contributors not defined in our na- tional survey, the need for further investigations with re- spect to physiological considerations and more specific information on vulnerable groups and high consumers through the conduct of a survey on biomarkers for exposure including also socio-economic aspects to better assist risk managers in their decision-making.

It creates the false impression of scientific controversy and does not engage with the scientific substance of our report. As we have shown, Lamb et al.\u2019s attempt of deconstructing the UNEP/WHO (2013) report is not particularly erudite scientifically. It appears that the critique is not intended to be persuasive to the scientific community, but is designed to speak to bureaucrats, politicians and other decision makers not intimately familiar with the topic of endocrine disruption and therefore susceptible to false generalizations of bias and subjectivity. It is important to recognize that while we drafted this response, evidence has come to light of sustained and concerted lobbying efforts by American and European chemical industries aimed at delaying European Commission efforts to implement regulations for endocrine disrupters (Horel, 2015), especially in the context of the ongoing negotiations of the Trans- atlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTaisen IguchiP) between the USA and the EU. Importantly, many of these same lobbying organiza- tions have funded the critique by Lamb et al. (2014). The alignment of the conclusions of Lamb et al. with the goal of the lobbying ef- forts of their funders certainly creates the appearance of a conflict of interest. Moreover, Lamb et al.'s lack of focus on scientific issues and the similarity in their type of criticisms with those developed by the Tobacco Industry make it difficult to conclude anything but that the funders recruited writers known to have industry-friendly themes in their historical writing to \u201ccritique\u201d the 2013 UNEP/WHO report. Finally, the concept of \u201ccontroversy\u201d in science must be viewed appropriately, as articulated well by Blaise Pascal in the 1600s (Auden and Kronenberger, 1966): \u201cContradiction is not an indica- tion of false, nor is lack of contradiction a sign of truth.\u201d Conflicts of interest As in our efforts to produce the 2013 UNEP/WHO report, the authors were not supported by any outside stakeholders in writing this response. There are therefore no conflicts of interests as co- authors of the present article, and all coauthors have declared this in writing.

As discussed above, these measures are lim- ited in their inferential value, but nonetheless have been evaluated in the literature. This report provides a review of the literature, and presents additional analyses of available national survey data sets. Results from the analyses provided herein indicate that menthol cigarette use is not associated with an earlier age of initiating smoking or a greater likelihood of being a daily versus non-daily smoker; and, that menthol cigarette preference is not greater among new, less-experienced compared to more-established youth smokers. While there are limitations regarding the infer- ences that can be drawn on whether menthol cigarette use is pos- itively or negatively associated with smoking initiation and/or progression to regular smoking, these data indicate that menthol in cigarettes does not adversely affect those measures that are readily examined using cross-sectional data.

Rousselle et al. / Regulatory Toxicology and Pharmacology 65 (2013) 7\u201311 the existing OECD test guidelines do not cover all aspects of the MoAs associated with endocrine disruption (the OECD conceptual framework is focused mainly on androgen, estrogen, and thyroid effects). Furthermore, the existing OECD test guidelines do not nec- essarily cover all relevant time windows of susceptibility. The sub- groups highlighted the need for revised existing test guidelines or new OECD\u2019s test guidelines to include endpoints for effects of other types of endocrine systems as well as more specific endocrine dis- ruptor endpoints for androgen, estrogen, and thyroid disruption (e.g., nipple retention for anti-androgenicity). Because science is moving fast in this area, the results from non-guideline studies that show effects linked to endocrine disruption should be taken into account in a weight of evidence approach. However, a transparent study evaluation should be conducted for non-OECD-guideline and non-GLP studies (e.g., using Klimisch categories, reliability of labo- ratories or other well-recognized guidance; (Klimisch et al., 1997). In addition, in each case, the reliability and the plausibility of the effects observed and the relevance for humans should be evalu- ated, the default assumption being human relevance. In general, academic studies should not overrule OECD\u2019s studies and vice versa. 2.5. Point of departure and uncertainty factors The subgroups were invited to discuss the best approach for risk assessment of ED. The subgroups generally agreed that the bench- mark dose approach (BMD) represents a confident methodology when enough data are available. Nevertheless, for ED, a BMD or NOAEL/LOAEL combined with the use of uncertainty factors is both useful for risk assessment purposes. However, usefulness of this approach is limited to data sets we know show monotonic dose\u2013 response curves, and the following question was raised, \u2018\u2018If we take into account a non-monotonic dose\u2013response curves, then what should we do in order to conduct proper risk assessment?\u2019\u2019 No definitive answers resulted from the discussion, except that there is a need to explore this further. 2.6. Exposure assessment The subgroups also reviewed exposure assessment and factors that need to be considered for studies on ED. It was agreed that it is essential that the exposure is assessed at the timepoints when the individual is most susceptible, that is at the windows of sus- ceptibility. During these critical windows, a low dose may lead to irreversible effects and also to effects that are specific for this time window. In fact, because of the sensitive regulation control medi- ated by the hormonal system, this notion may be particularly important for ED. However, these critical time windows of suscep- tibility are in principle covered when multigeneration reproductive toxicity studies (e.g., according to OECD 416) are combined with studies on developmental toxicity (e.g., according to OECD 414) and long-term studies (e.g., according to OECD 453) in different species like it is required for pesticides, food additives, food resi- dues of veterinary drugs or high production volume (HPV) chemi- cals. However, a major limitation of these studies is that currently, they do not include all endocrine relevant endpoints. Nevertheless, no current OECD protocol for mammals covers the time frame from in utero exposure to senescence. According to the subgroups, all relevant routes of exposure should be addressed, recognizing that the absorption and local metabolism may differ depending on the route of exposure, which may impact the systemic dose. Some- times it is impossible to estimate the systemic level with the pri- mary exposure route. An approach could be to define an internal dose (blood or tissue concentration at the target organ) or concen- tration versus time relationship and to derive an equivalent oral exposure dose from the different exposure scenarios. Physiologi- cally based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) models or appropriate non- compartmental models may be used to this end (WHO, 2010) when they are sufficiently developed. It would in this context also be very valuable if blood levels were measured in the animal tox- icity studies. Participants highlighted the fact that there is a lack of knowl- edge about occurrence of ED in many consumer products and the resulting exposure levels. Furthermore, there is a need to docu- ment exposure from the environment sources (e.g., indoor air, set- tled dust, food and water), which contribute to the total exposure. The subgroups stated that it may be appropriate to develop a com- mon database on concentrations of ED in the environment, includ- ing food, consumer products, and human biomonitoring data as a complement to data in the REACH registrations. It is crucially important to manage such a database carefully in order to achieve comparable data with validated methodology. Furthermore, it was realized that there are a number of challenges in the use of human biomonitoring data for risk assessment. Cumulative exposure to various ED should be considered as this may lead to combined effects, additive or synergistic, particularly if they impact the same targets or metabolic pathways. The cumula- tive exposure to ED should in most cases be considered as additive if the substances act through the same MoA (act on same targets or metabolic pathways). The subgroups also suggested that realistic probabilistic tools should be used if possible. 2.7. Regulatory issues related to ED Some of the participants pointed out discrepancies between hazard-based regulations for plant protection products and bio- cides regarding ED and risk-based regulation for chemicals under REACH even though the identification of ED is hazard based under REACH. The regulation of ED in e.g., cosmetics, food additives, med- icines and food contact materials is also important. According to the participants, an important task for risk asses- sors is to conduct the risk assessment in a transparent way, e.g., by ensuring a, thorough description regarding the way how uncer- tainties have been taken into account, e.g., whether critical time windows of exposure have been covered by the studies conducted and if studies include the relevant endocrine endpoints. 3. Recommendations At the end of the workshop, the working group made a few rec- ommendations (or a wish list) for future progress in relation to risk assessment of ED. Concerning exposure, the working group suggested the following: \ufffd To use every-day realistic exposure scenarios, especially for ubiquitous endocrine compounds. \ufffd To develop a public database that contains data on concentra- tions of compounds in products and in the environment, includ- ing human biomonitoring data. \ufffd To prepare a database that contains data on exposure from mul- tiple products and exposure routes and also for exposure to sev- eral different compounds with similar MoA (step-by-step approach). Concerning studies, the working group suggested the following: \ufffd To develop guidance for assessing quality of non-guideline/non- GLP studies. C. Rousselle et al. / Regulatory Toxicology and Pharmacology 65 (2013) 7\u201311 11 Concerning the OECD\u2019s test guidelines, the working group made the following recommendations: \ufffd In addition to the blood hormone levels, the blood endocrine disruptor substance levels, including the parent compounds and the metabolites, should be measured (for pesticides this is already done for every active substance since OECD 417 toxic- okinetic study is mandatory). \ufffd In toxicity studies, the use of a larger number of doses, covering especially the low-dose regions, is encouraged. \ufffd Knowledge of susceptible time windows of exposure as well as sensitive endpoints should be reflected in toxicity studies. \ufffd In addition, other parts of the endocrine system than andro- genic, estrogenic or thyroid (e.g., pancreatic, adrenal etc.) should be addressed by inclusion of new endpoints in the OECD test guidelines, conceptual framework and guidance documents when ED is considered. Concerning research needs, the working group identified the following ideas that need to be taken into consideration: \ufffd Models should be developed for carcinogenic effects linked to ED and to the MoAs for such effects. \ufffd A hazard and risk assessment methodology should be devel- oped to investigate, in the context of ED, how to consider recur- rent exposures (repetitive exposures) across different critical time windows of sensitivity. \ufffd Use of the PBPK models for ED in risk assessment should be improved. \ufffd Research needs to be conducted to understand mechanisms behind non-monotonic dose\u2013response curves. Finally, the participants underlined the need for more exchange in the future to share experiences and improve the science related to endocrine disrupting chemicals and their intrinsic risk associ- ated with the general population.

Earlier animal studies found melamine had no carcinogenicity. Although some of the later experiments found bladder cancer in the animals fed with high doses of melamine, it is believed to be a secondary disease caused by bladder calculus-stimulated epithe- lial proliferation rather than a direct result of melamine. At pres- ent, melamine is considered as indirect, non-genotoxic carcinogen. In addition, evaluation and data of carcinogenic effect of melamine on human are not available. In this study, the ability of melamine to induce human cell malignant transformation was examined by observing cell morphology, cell growth ability and biochemical phenotype (such as loss of density dependence, loss of contact with inhibition, loss of adherent growth characteristics) of human liver cells treated with melamine. Compared with the well-known carcinogen AFB1, which induced malignant transfor- mation of liver cells in a short period of time, showing overlapped cell layers, irregularly cell arrangement, changed cell morphology and lost contact inhibition and density dependence in growth curve, 6 months of melamine treatment could not induce malig- nant transformation of human liver cells. Soft-agar test as an excellent method for further identification of malignant cell trans- formation has good compliance with malignant transformation rate. Unlike AFB1, which induced malignant transformation and loss of adherent growth characteristics of cells as indicated by cell survival, growth and colony formation in soft agar, melamine failed to induce cell growth in soft agar even after long time treatment, suggesting that melamine is not carcinogenic and could not induce malignant cell transformation. In short, although melamine has no mutagenic function in pro- karyotes and eukaryotes in vitro and in vivo and does not have abil- ity to induce malignant cell transformation after long-term treatment, it has ability to increase sperm deformity rate and DNA damage, showing for the first time in sperm abnormality test and the sperm single cell gel electrophoresis.

In our case we have used the 28-day (OECD 407) guideline study to obtain 0.2 ml of plasma used for metabolome investigations. This procedure does not interfere with the outcome of the study and it is conceivable that other technologies, e.g. transcriptomics, could also be com- bined with regulatory OECD studies without compromising their validity. The combination of classical observations, including full pathology, and the mechanistic information provided by e.g. metabolomics, provides an ideal basis for comparison of com- pounds. Within the MetaMap\u00aeTox system that we use we obtain the comparison of a selected compound with all other compounds (currently ca. 800) based on their metabolomic profile within a few seconds. For large numbers of chemicals rapid information on po- tential biological similarity is a great advantage to start a more thorough evaluation of toxicological similarities. The omics infor- mation, together with the evaluation of the classical toxicological parameters from the 28-day study, then forms the basis of a sub- stantiated claim to waive the performance of the 90-day study for the selected compound, if the reference compound(s) are/is convincingly similar. The data-base used to prepare the case study is at this time only suitable for systemic toxicity (i.e. predicting the toxicity of compounds for short-term to subchronic administration periods. It is not suitable for reproduction toxicity as we have not gathered metabolome profiles for this end-point. It may be quite suitable to investigate maternal toxicity or effects on fertility in parental animals. Wether this technology could also be used to assess embryo-toxicity or effects on the next generation is an open question. Read across is andwill remain themost important tool to reduce animal testing while providing risk assessors with the necessary information to do their work. Ball et al. (2016) note that clear focal points of work to enhance the good use of the read across concept are amongst others, to identify best practices for using biological profiling/bioinformatics tools to support establishing similarity of source and target chemicals in read-across. Failure to derive some best practices for their use will likely lead to significant uncertainty into how to use these tools effectively and also create some mistrust in the data where they are not used appropriately. Here were demonstrate that data from new technologies can help to increase the quality of read across cases and should enhance the likelihood of providing successful cases to the regulatory author- ities. It should be noted, however, that in the present study target and source substances were structurally very similar, as this was a prerequisite to serve as a case study within the RAAF context. The great upside potential of such new technologies could be that they do not necessarily have to rely on an estimate of chemical simi- larity, but rather provide a biological foundation for similarity. We have referred to this concept earlier as \u201cgoing from QSAR to QBAR\u201d (quantitative biological activity relationship) (van Ravenzwaay et al., 2012). Such a concept would significantly enlarge the possi- bilities for read-across cases, while reducing the risk of incorrect read across proposals because occasionally small changes in chemical structures can have profound toxicological consequences. Further case studies are needed to demonstrate that this potential can indeed come to fruition, ideally also using other \u2018omics technologies. A further, and far more significant step towards the reduction of animal testing and provision of mechanistic information would be to perform metabolomics studies in vitro. This can indeed be done in vitro, and we have established a system for the identification of liver toxicity modes of action as well as cell energy metabolism (Balcke et al., 2011; Bordag et al., 2016). It should be noted, however, that the experimental set-up and establishment of a robust and reproducible test system is time consuming. Only when this is achieved can the development of a database with reference com- pounds be started. This process then has to be repeated for at least all major organs investigated in regulatory toxicity studies. This is achievable, but requires stamina, patience and a lot of commitment. 9. Disclaimer This case study has been designed to illustrate specific issues associated with read-across and stimulate discussion on the topic. It is not intended to be related to any currently ongoing regulatory discussions on this group of compounds. The background docu- ment has been prepared to facilitate the discussion at the Topical Scientific Workshop and does not necessarily represent ECHA's position.

Legal requirements should be introduced concerning information on skin sensitizers in different product types intended for consumer and professional use. Labeling of products plays an important role, however limited, in the prevention of allergic contact dermatitis. Ingredient labeling of cosmetic products, by uniform terminology (International Nomenclature of Cosmetic Ingredients, or INCI) and irrespective of concentration, is required according to the European Union\u2019s (EU) Cosmetics Directive (EC, 1976). This contributes to minimize allergic contact dermatitis.

Importantly, this MOA is rodent specific and does not elicit tumor formation in humans (Holsapple et al., 2006; Elcombe et al., 2014). Therefore, previous findings of liver tumors in MIBK-exposed mice should be re-evaluated and interpreted in light of these data, including the assessment of hu- man relevance of the rodent liver tumors.

The proportion of resistant Enterococci was markedly influenced in the 0.436 mg/mL dose group and the population of B. fragilis was sup- pressed significantly under treatment of 4.36 mg/mL tilmicosin. Up- regulation of the virulence gene gelE and the detection of the high- level macrolide resistance gene (ermB) were induced by long-time exposure to 43.6 mg/mL tilmicosin. Therefore, the present ADI recommended by JECFA and EMEA may be not safe for the human intestinal microflora. The co-occurrence of virulence and resistance genes is a potential hazard to public health. Conflicts of interest Author has no conflicts of interest to declare.

The data are judged with a moderately high degree of confidence to adequately explain the development of thyroid follicular-cell tumors in rats following chronic dietary exposure to pronamide. The hypothesized mode of action (MoA) for this effect is altered homeostasis of the HPT axis occurring through the following key events: (1) liver enzyme induction, including uridine diphosphate glucuronosyltransferase (UGT), resulting in (2) increased hepatic metabolism and biliary excretion of thyroxine (T4), leading to (3) decreased serum T4 concentration. The decrease in serum T4 leads to (4) activation of the HPT axis and (5) increased circulating TSH. The increase in serum TSH stimulates (6) thyroid follicular cell hypertrophy which progresses to follicular-cell hyperplasia and thyroid neoplasms with sustained elevations in TSH. These six key events have been evaluated in a series of guideline and MoA studies aimed at identifying the causa- tive and associated events leading to thyroid follicular cell tumors in the carcinogenicity study. With regards to human relevance of these tumors, there is considerable evidence in the literature to strongly support quantitative differences in the normal physio- logical processes for thyroid homeostasis; therefore, one can con- clude that thyroid tumors induced in rodents by this MoA (i.e., enhanced hepatic clearance of thyroid hormone and altered HPT homeostasis) is not likely to increase thyroid tumor formation in humans.

For part of the toy-slimes (35%) and putties (13%) the migration of boron was not in compliance with legal limits. For toy-slime, the health based guidance value is exceeded at a migration of 3200 mg/kg and higher. The legal limit thus provides adequate protection. The measured mi- grations in the Dutch marked surveillance of boron do not lead to a health risk. However, in RAPEX higher concentrations were reported that would lead to concern. Monitoring of boron in these products should therefore be continued. In two toy-slimes and two putties the carcinogenic substance NDELA was detected. For the toy-slimes the MoE of the estimated exposure to NDELA was lower than 104 and therefore a health risk is implied. For the putties, the estimated exposure to NDELA resulted in a MoE higher than 104. When legal limit values are set for toys, an allocation of 10% could be applied (SCHER, 2010), which is usually done in case background exposure from other sources is relevant. When this allocation is applied, the calculated NDELA exposure is of concern. Furthermore, nitrosamine formation can be avoided by selection of suitable raw materials, there- fore NDELA should not be present in these toys at all.", "Acknowledgement": "Acknowledgement The authors thank Mireille Dammer, Maryam Talebi-Alenjareghi, Tessa Bijlsma, Natascha Jager and Anne Draaijer (Chemical & Micro- biological Product Safety Laboratory, NVWA) for carrying out the ana- lyses.

The results of the Ames assays on MSS TPM are consistent with the tobacco blends in most cigarillos being composed of only air-cured tobaccos. The results from the NRU cytotoxicity and in vitro micronucleus clastogenicity assays were not consistent with the tobacco blends in most cigarillos being composed of only air-cured tobaccos as those assays indicated that toxicities were higher for TPM from the cigarillos than those for the TPM from blended cigarettes. The reasons for these unexpected findings are not clear, but may involve the composition of the wrappers and binders (if present) used on the cigarillos.

This was generally performed for each of three slides for each test compound and selected positive control treatment. Five solvent control slides were also scored. The assay was considered to be valid if: (1) the mean net grain count for solvent control treated cul- tures was not greater than 0; and (2) the positive control chemical induced increases in mean net grain count of 5 or more, and more than 50% of cells had net grain counts of 5 or greater.

Further, interpretation of the human data for lung cancer from ana- lytical epidemiological studies is complicated by numerous weak- nesses of the studies (e.g., lack of naphthalene exposure estimates, low potential exposure, confounding by smoking), such that no firm conclusions about the presence or absence of risk can be made. With these significant caveats, it can nevertheless be noted that no occupationally-related risks of lung cancer were identified in the industries evaluated.

Knowl- edge exchange between experts including different experiences is critical in this evolving area. This meeting brought together experts from different angle of non-clinical development of biologics, toxicologists as well as PK scientists. Beyond lectures, podium dis- cussions were held after most sessions to get more insights into individual case examples and our current understanding. This approach gets more importance since there is still limited or no access to primary company data bases for retrospective analysis of (failed) development studies. Finally, further initiatives have been discussed, like support of symposia in the N3Rs area with case examples or compiling of existing data for better support of species selection, which will be discussed at the next meeting.

Data from this study reinforced the Spon- sor\u2019s view that anidulafungin and voriconazole used in combina- tion are not likely to result in any novel toxicities, do not lead to additive or synergistic liver toxicity, and have a similar safety pro- file in juvenile animals compared with adult animals. This work thereby provides evidence to support the safety of the combination of voriconazole and anidulafungin in future clinical trials in chil- dren with invasive fungal infections.

Most degenerative or functional changes in the pig- mentation the renal cytoplasm are not related (Gopinath et al., 1987). In this study, we did not determine the composition of the brown pigment, but evidence of tubular damage was not ob- served and so the pigmentation was not considered an adverse ef- fect. Because, in both male and female rats (at 500, 1000, and 2000 mg/kg/day), BUN and CREA levels were in the normal ranges. In the stomach of some female rats, mild erosion of the mucosa was observed after HHT treatment at 2000 mg/kg/day. Because the erosion of the epithelial cells of gastric mucosa showed focal erosion, cell damage, and deposition of HHT, the erosion was con- sidered related to HHT administration. In conclusion, there was no abnormal mortality, body weight, food consumption, ophthalmo- logical changes, biochemistry, haematology, or organ weight changes as a result of repeated oral administration of HHT at 0, 250, 750, or 2000 mg/kg/day for 13 weeks. However, in rats receiv- ing HHT at 2000 mg/kg/day, adverse reactions were frequently ob- served in the histopathology and urinalysis such as, urine and stomach mucosa, as respectively. Under our experimental condi- tions, the NOAEL of HHT for rats of either sex was 750 mg/kg/ day. Because HHT administration is used long-term in clinical ther- apy, to understand its safety better, the chronic and genotoxicity of HHT should be investigated after repeated administration of the drug.

(2013) as we confirm the presence in the market of hair straightening product that release high amounts of FA enables to create a potential risk for irreversible effects not only for hairstylists and salon customers, but also for bystanders.

Galli et al. / Regulatory Toxicology and Pharmacology 72 (2015) 562\u2013568 567 and Health Administration (OSHA) has created a standard for pro- tection against FA. The standard details methods of compliance to be implemented if exposure is above the permissible exposure limit (PEL) for workers of 0.75 ppm as an 8-h time-weighted aver- age (TWA). The Standard Additions include the short-term expo- sure limit (STEL) that cannot be exceeded for any 15-min period \u2013 2 ppm, and the action limit \u2013 0.5 ppm (OSHA, 1999). The German Research Foundation (Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft \u2013 DFG) (DFG, 2000) proposed a maximum concentration of 0.3 ppm FA for workers applying FA-containing products used as hair straighteners and the German Federal Institute of Risk Assessment (BfR, 2005) established a permissible exposure limit of 0.1 ppm or 1.24 mg/m3 for the population.

Since many of the products under study are potentially inhaled, the incor- poration of an inhalation model to account for inhalation for these types of products is required. Fragrance materials are used in vari- ous household products and air care products (as are several other ingredients in personal care products and cosmetics), so the data- base would need to be extended to include these additional product categories. Also, some fragrance materials are chemically identical to some flavouring materials also used in food products, and many other chemicals are present in both consumer products and food simultaneously. Therefore, it would be it is necessary to expand the Creme RIFM Model to include a food consumption model for exposure to flavours and other chemicals, thus allowing the estima- tion of aggregate exposure to both fragrances and flavours, as well as other ingredients. It would be beneficial to include other European countries as well as other parts of the world such as Asia. Conflict of interest The authors report no conflicts of interest.

Ding et al. / Regulatory Toxicology and Pharmacology 61 (2011) 296\u2013309 OELs than most European lists (except Luxemburg and EU). These Asian lists were much influenced by the ACGIH lists in the 1980s concerning both substance selection and limit setting. The influ- ences of the ACGIH on the European lists took place mainly before the 1980s and have been followed by many revisions of the Euro- peans lists. 6. Conclusion The TLVs of the ACGIH have historically influenced the lists of OELs set by most of the 25 organizations which have been investi- gated in this study, but this influence has decreased substantially, at least in Europe. Previous studies indicate that there is a potential trend of convergence within the European Union based on the EU\u2019s indicative and binding OELs. However, the comparisons of sub- stance selection and value setting for OELs reported in this study reveal large international differences both in substance selection and the level of OELs.

Ding et al. / Regulatory Toxicology and Pharmacology 61 (2011) 296\u2013309 OELs than most European lists (except Luxemburg and EU). These Asian lists were much influenced by the ACGIH lists in the 1980s concerning both substance selection and limit setting. The influ- ences of the ACGIH on the European lists took place mainly before the 1980s and have been followed by many revisions of the Euro- peans lists. 6. Conclusion The TLVs of the ACGIH have historically influenced the lists of OELs set by most of the 25 organizations which have been investi- gated in this study, but this influence has decreased substantially, at least in Europe. Previous studies indicate that there is a potential trend of convergence within the European Union based on the EU\u2019s indicative and binding OELs. However, the comparisons of sub- stance selection and value setting for OELs reported in this study reveal large international differences both in substance selection and the level of OELs. Conflict of interest statement The authors declare that there are no conflicts of interest. Acknowledgments Qian Ding\u2019s participation has been funded by China Scholarship Council (CSC).

Under these experimental conditions, the no-observed-adverse- effect level of 2-methylbutane was 300 mg/kg/day for general toxicity and 1000 mg/kg/day for reproductive capacity and pup development in rats. The present results are expected to provide information on the reproductive and developmental toxic effects and target organ toxicity of 2-methylbutane via repeated oral administration which can aid in the process of risk assessment.

However, a screening assessment was undertaken using a provi- sional risk assessment for surface water based on five hypothetical values for the methylation rate in three possible scenarios (worst, average and best case). In the best and the average cases, the expected methyl mercury concentrations in fish related to con- tributions of dental amalgam uses are well below maximum tolerable content of methyl mercury in fish. In the worst case sce- nario, the values obtained with the two highest methylation rates exceeded the threshold. Thus, in the worst case, mitigation mea- sures are expected to be needed to reduce the risk. Further, the WFD\u2019s threshold for secondary poisoning is exceeded at methyla- tion rates higher than 0.005%. Therefore, compliance with the WFD threshold would contribute to the prevention of human health effects (see http://ec.europa.eu/health/scientific_commit- tees/environmental_risks/docs/scher_o_165.pdf). With regard to human health, the SCHER is of the opinion that the conclusions of the 2008-opinion are still valid. For health effects due to alternative materials particularly the potential leak- age of bisphenol A (Bis-DMA), the SCHER recommends referring to the SCENIHR opinion on the use of bisphenol A in medical devices5."}},

Charles et al. / Regulatory Toxicology and Pharmacology 81 (2016) 47e5656 reproducibility of the experimental protocol designed for testing reproductive toxicity of chemicals with L. stagnalis according to the draft OECD Test Guideline. In addition, it allowed optimizing the experimental design in terms of test duration and choice of the core reproductive endpoint. Based on our results a test duration of 28 days is recommended for the reproduction toxicity test with L. stagnalis. As the core test endpoint, we recommend to use the mean cumulative number of clutches per individual-day, calculated over 28 days, providing that the number of clutches is determined at least twice a week using six replicates of five snails (at test initiation) per treatment with at least five concentrations plus a control treatment. Such a test design was proved as optimal, making the reproduction toxicity test both sensitive and cost effective for estimating accurate ECx values according to current OECD requirements.

Besides hazard classification, the read- across paradigm presented here can be used to identify the proper source substance from which to read across Derived No Effect Lev- els (DNELs) for various toxicity endpoints. The grouping based on bioaccessibility can be extended to other divalent inorganic nickel substances as well as some organic substances when sufficient data are available to make a valid assessment. In addition, one key limitation to note is that this paradigm does not address the potential toxicity of any counter-ion that may be present. There- fore, application of these data for read-across to other substances should only be conducted when counter-ion toxicity has been excluded. This requires generation of minimal in vivo toxicity data to verify results of bioaccessibility testing. It is important to note that in all cases, data generated from actual in vivo toxicity studies supersede any conclusions that could be made based on this read- across assessment. Assessments based on bioaccessibility data must be made for each route of exposure by investigating metal ion release in relevant biological fluids, such as synthetic lung flu- ids for inhalation and synthetic sweat for dermal. This approach enables a more scientifically valid read-across that can be end- point- and exposure-route specific, which means that there may be a different source substance identified for each route of expo- sure. Hence, not all endpoints for one target substance will be read across from the same source substance as is the case when using simple water solubility as bases for extrapolation.

At higher doses the effects were consistent across all studies up until doses of 125 mg/kg/ day when the condition of the monkeys required euthanasia. One fe- male died after several administrations of 75 mg/kg/day but this was less clearly an effect of the test substance although it cannot be ex- cluded. In general, the signs seen were exaggerated aspects of canna- binoid pharmacology: weakness, incoordination, hypothermia and so were probably attributable to the pharmacological action of BIA 10\u20132474. As expected, such cannabinoid-like effects showed tolerance and so, with a prior up-titration period, doses up to 100 mg/kg or 75 mg/kg were tolerated for 4- and 13-weeks respectively. The clinical signs at these doses were moderate but resolved quickly once treatment with BIA 10-2474 stopped. There were some histopathological signs at the higher doses but these rarely passed a severity score of 1 on a 5- point scale and resolved after treatment cessation. It is possible that the neuronal dystrophy and edema seen at high doses (and which had a severity score of 2) is related to the signs seen in the clinic but the exposure levels required to induce these signs in monkeys was con- siderably higher than that attained in the clinic (monkey NOAEL 75 mg/kg/day, mean Cmax = 20,600 ng/mL, mean AUC0- t = 134,350 ng h/mL; humans at 50 mg day 1, mean Cmax = 667 ng/ mL, mean AUC0-t = 7768 ng h/mL, so any link must remain spec- ulative. The study directors for these studies attributed an NOAEL of 100 mg/kg/day for the 4-week study and 75 mg/kg/day for the 13- week study. Overall, these results show that the toxicological potential of BIA 10\u20132474 is mainly characterized by functional effects, which were generated by the pronounced pharmacological actions of this compound on the cannabinoid system.

At higher doses the effects were consistent across all studies up until doses of 125 mg/kg/ day when the condition of the monkeys required euthanasia. One fe- male died after several administrations of 75 mg/kg/day but this was less clearly an effect of the test substance although it cannot be ex- cluded. In general, the signs seen were exaggerated aspects of canna- binoid pharmacology: weakness, incoordination, hypothermia and so were probably attributable to the pharmacological action of BIA 10\u20132474. As expected, such cannabinoid-like effects showed tolerance and so, with a prior up-titration period, doses up to 100 mg/kg or 75 mg/kg were tolerated for 4- and 13-weeks respectively. The clinical signs at these doses were moderate but resolved quickly once treatment with BIA 10-2474 stopped. There were some histopathological signs at the higher doses but these rarely passed a severity score of 1 on a 5- point scale and resolved after treatment cessation. It is possible that the neuronal dystrophy and edema seen at high doses (and which had a severity score of 2) is related to the signs seen in the clinic but the exposure levels required to induce these signs in monkeys was con- siderably higher than that attained in the clinic (monkey NOAEL 75 mg/kg/day, mean Cmax = 20,600 ng/mL, mean AUC0- t = 134,350 ng h/mL; humans at 50 mg day 1, mean Cmax = 667 ng/ mL, mean AUC0-t = 7768 ng h/mL, so any link must remain spec- ulative. The study directors for these studies attributed an NOAEL of 100 mg/kg/day for the 4-week study and 75 mg/kg/day for the 13- week study. Overall, these results show that the toxicological potential of BIA 10\u20132474 is mainly characterized by functional effects, which were generated by the pronounced pharmacological actions of this compound on the cannabinoid system.

Most importantly, FDA is taking the concerns of its critics regarding conflict of interest (COI) policy rather seriously. At the heart of the NGO critique regarding COI is the \u201ccommon knowledge\u201d requirement for evidence of sci- entific consensus among qualified experts regarding safety based on available data and its apparent clash with the reality that qualified experts generally are compensated for reviewing data and providing their expert opinion. Critics have also noted that certain experts have participated in an inordinate number of GRAS de- terminations over the years. Again, this criticism clashes with the reality that those very same experts sat on the Select Committee on GRAS Substances (SCOGS) that reviewed the GRAS/food additive status of hundreds of ingredients at the request of FDA, and were therefore sought out by industry precisely because of this critical experience and high credibility with the agency (US FDA, 2015). Seeking the same expertise that FDA sought and relied upon is not a conflict of interest. Nonetheless, both GAO (US GAO, 2010) and the NGOs urged FDA to issue guidance on COIs (e.g., Pew Charitable Trusts, 2013; CSPI, 2015; Neltner and Maffini, 2014). Given that FDA views the COI issue as relevant for both FDA reviews and GRAS D.B. McColl, E.R. Janus / Regulatory Toxicology and Pharmacology 79 (2016) S95eS98 S97 self-determinations, the agency plans to issue COI guidance in the future. Regarding the call for post-market review of food in- gredients, FDA has considered the utility of collecting data on actual marketplace use patterns so it could then prioritize substances for cyclical review; however, it lacks the authority from Congress to require industry to submit such market data."}},

For example, use a graphical representation to il- lustrate uncertainty versus sensitivity in low, medium, and high cate- gories (Fig. 4, adopted from (Meek et al., 2013). Clearly state the de- finition of low, medium, and high uncertainty and sensitivity, since these levels can be necessarily subjective. 2.5.3. Model applicability In this section, present how the PBPK model is used, including modeling results for its intended applications (for example, to derive an interspecies extrapolation factor). Summarize the levels of confidence or uncertainty associated with the intended application. For example, these levels may be based on the robustness of the model in simulating the underlying biological mechanisms, or knowledge and data used to support major assumptions in modeling analysis. Clarify model limita- tions and domains of applicability. 2.6. Discussion and conclusions In this section, briefly reiterate the following information: \u2022 The question to be answered or hypothesis to be tested \u2022 An explanation of why a PBPK model is required or preferred \u2022 A summary of how the PBPK model helps address the question \u2022 A summary of modeling analysis (for example, a rat and human model for the chemical with oral and inhalation routes of exposure) \u2022 A highlight of key results and interpretation of these results (for example, magnitude of difference between rat and human dose metrics, or linear or saturable kinetics at doses up to some level) \u2022 A discussion of the uncertainties and limitations of the model (for example, sensitive parameters that are assumed to be the same across species but without data to confirm) If PBPK modeling analysis is one piece of evidence addressing the questions, include other pieces of evidence in the discussion. 2.7. Electronic files and supporting documents Provide electronic files and supporting documents with the main report. Examples of electronic files include model code, metadata, parameter tables, and simulation inputs/outputs. Examples of sup- porting documents include reports summarizing in vivo studies that provide the time-concentration data for model calibration or evalua- tion, or in vitro studies that measure chemical absorption or metabo- lism. \u2022 Include all materials related to the modeling history, and justifica- tion of modeling strategies, model parameterization, and model evaluation/verification/qualification, as well as model equations, if they are too long to be included in the main report. \u2022 Provide references that contain model equations or approaches for obtaining default parameter values, as well as user manuals for commercial PBPK software programs. \u2022 Provide a document with step-by-step instructions for running the model and generating tables/figures found in the main report. \u2022 When possible, documentation quality practices followed by the model developer's organization, and/or third-party review of the modeling analysis. 2.8. Appendices In this section, include a table of acronyms and abbreviations, a list of tables, a list of figures, and references. When possible, use hyperlinks in the main report to cross-reference tables, figures, and references. Discussion & conclusions This harmonized PBPK reporting template can be used in various ways, including providing clear guidance on critical elements evaluated during regulatory review processes. The template will also reduce the burden on investigators who may otherwise prepare separate reports for various regulatory jurisdictions or agencies, using the identical modeling analysis. Adapted from existing guidance templates (for ex- ample, USFDA, 2018; EMA, 2019), this template recommends addi- tional elements when using PBPK models to evaluate the safety of en- vironmental chemicals. Therefore, this general template can be applied to submitting models for both environmental chemicals and pharma- ceuticals. This template is also a good starting point for the develop- ment of a new OECD Harmonized Template (OHT) (http://www.oecd. org/ehs/templates) to report PBPK models for chemical risk assessment and regulatory uses. This template has additional contexts of use beyond the regulatory sphere, including submitting and sharing PBPK-related studies (for ex- ample, for peer-reviewed publication or scientific collaborations), en- suring transparent communication between reviewers and model de- velopers, and training for new modelers and decision makers. Using this template will help standardize PBPK model reporting and commu- nication and thereby enhance their application and regulatory accep- tance. Declaration of interest The present study was subjected to review by the US Environmental Protection Agency's (USEPA) Office of Research and Development and Office of Pesticide Programs (USEPA), and US Food and Drug Administration (USFDA), and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention/Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry (CDC/ ATSDR) and was approved for publication.

For example, use a graphical representation to il- lustrate uncertainty versus sensitivity in low, medium, and high cate- gories (Fig. 4, adopted from (Meek et al., 2013). Clearly state the de- finition of low, medium, and high uncertainty and sensitivity, since these levels can be necessarily subjective. 2.5.3. Model applicability In this section, present how the PBPK model is used, including modeling results for its intended applications (for example, to derive an interspecies extrapolation factor). Summarize the levels of confidence or uncertainty associated with the intended application. For example, these levels may be based on the robustness of the model in simulating the underlying biological mechanisms, or knowledge and data used to support major assumptions in modeling analysis. Clarify model limita- tions and domains of applicability. 2.6. Discussion and conclusions In this section, briefly reiterate the following information: \u2022 The question to be answered or hypothesis to be tested \u2022 An explanation of why a PBPK model is required or preferred \u2022 A summary of how the PBPK model helps address the question \u2022 A summary of modeling analysis (for example, a rat and human model for the chemical with oral and inhalation routes of exposure) \u2022 A highlight of key results and interpretation of these results (for example, magnitude of difference between rat and human dose metrics, or linear or saturable kinetics at doses up to some level) \u2022 A discussion of the uncertainties and limitations of the model (for example, sensitive parameters that are assumed to be the same across species but without data to confirm) If PBPK modeling analysis is one piece of evidence addressing the questions, include other pieces of evidence in the discussion. 2.7. Electronic files and supporting documents Provide electronic files and supporting documents with the main report. Examples of electronic files include model code, metadata, parameter tables, and simulation inputs/outputs. Examples of sup- porting documents include reports summarizing in vivo studies that provide the time-concentration data for model calibration or evalua- tion, or in vitro studies that measure chemical absorption or metabo- lism. \u2022 Include all materials related to the modeling history, and justifica- tion of modeling strategies, model parameterization, and model evaluation/verification/qualification, as well as model equations, if they are too long to be included in the main report. \u2022 Provide references that contain model equations or approaches for obtaining default parameter values, as well as user manuals for commercial PBPK software programs. \u2022 Provide a document with step-by-step instructions for running the model and generating tables/figures found in the main report. \u2022 When possible, documentation quality practices followed by the model developer's organization, and/or third-party review of the modeling analysis. 2.8. Appendices In this section, include a table of acronyms and abbreviations, a list of tables, a list of figures, and references. When possible, use hyperlinks in the main report to cross-reference tables, figures, and references. Discussion & conclusions This harmonized PBPK reporting template can be used in various ways, including providing clear guidance on critical elements evaluated during regulatory review processes. The template will also reduce the burden on investigators who may otherwise prepare separate reports for various regulatory jurisdictions or agencies, using the identical modeling analysis. Adapted from existing guidance templates (for ex- ample, USFDA, 2018; EMA, 2019), this template recommends addi- tional elements when using PBPK models to evaluate the safety of en- vironmental chemicals. Therefore, this general template can be applied to submitting models for both environmental chemicals and pharma- ceuticals. This template is also a good starting point for the develop- ment of a new OECD Harmonized Template (OHT) (http://www.oecd. org/ehs/templates) to report PBPK models for chemical risk assessment and regulatory uses. This template has additional contexts of use beyond the regulatory sphere, including submitting and sharing PBPK-related studies (for ex- ample, for peer-reviewed publication or scientific collaborations), en- suring transparent communication between reviewers and model de- velopers, and training for new modelers and decision makers. Using this template will help standardize PBPK model reporting and commu- nication and thereby enhance their application and regulatory accep- tance.

competing interest Acknowledgments Supplementary data References", "Acknowledgement": "Therefore, to facilitate model evaluation, present the results of these analyses together. For example, use a graphical representation to il- lustrate uncertainty versus sensitivity in low, medium, and high cate- gories (Fig. 4, adopted from (Meek et al., 2013). Clearly state the de- finition of low, medium, and high uncertainty and sensitivity, since these levels can be necessarily subjective. 2.5.3. Model applicability In this section, present how the PBPK model is used, including modeling results for its intended applications (for example, to derive an interspecies extrapolation factor). Summarize the levels of confidence or uncertainty associated with the intended application. For example, these levels may be based on the robustness of the model in simulating the underlying biological mechanisms, or knowledge and data used to support major assumptions in modeling analysis. Clarify model limita- tions and domains of applicability. 2.6. Discussion and conclusions In this section, briefly reiterate the following information: \u2022 The question to be answered or hypothesis to be tested \u2022 An explanation of why a PBPK model is required or preferred \u2022 A summary of how the PBPK model helps address the question \u2022 A summary of modeling analysis (for example, a rat and human model for the chemical with oral and inhalation routes of exposure) \u2022 A highlight of key results and interpretation of these results (for example, magnitude of difference between rat and human dose metrics, or linear or saturable kinetics at doses up to some level) \u2022 A discussion of the uncertainties and limitations of the model (for example, sensitive parameters that are assumed to be the same across species but without data to confirm) If PBPK modeling analysis is one piece of evidence addressing the questions, include other pieces of evidence in the discussion. 2.7. Electronic files and supporting documents Provide electronic files and supporting documents with the main report. Examples of electronic files include model code, metadata, parameter tables, and simulation inputs/outputs. Examples of sup- porting documents include reports summarizing in vivo studies that provide the time-concentration data for model calibration or evalua- tion, or in vitro studies that measure chemical absorption or metabo- lism. \u2022 Include all materials related to the modeling history, and justifica- tion of modeling strategies, model parameterization, and model evaluation/verification/qualification, as well as model equations, if they are too long to be included in the main report. \u2022 Provide references that contain model equations or approaches for obtaining default parameter values, as well as user manuals for commercial PBPK software programs. \u2022 Provide a document with step-by-step instructions for running the model and generating tables/figures found in the main report. \u2022 When possible, documentation quality practices followed by the model developer's organization, and/or third-party review of the modeling analysis. 2.8. Appendices In this section, include a table of acronyms and abbreviations, a list of tables, a list of figures, and references. When possible, use hyperlinks in the main report to cross-reference tables, figures, and references. Discussion & conclusions This harmonized PBPK reporting template can be used in various ways, including providing clear guidance on critical elements evaluated during regulatory review processes. The template will also reduce the burden on investigators who may otherwise prepare separate reports for various regulatory jurisdictions or agencies, using the identical modeling analysis. Adapted from existing guidance templates (for ex- ample, USFDA, 2018; EMA, 2019), this template recommends addi- tional elements when using PBPK models to evaluate the safety of en- vironmental chemicals. Therefore, this general template can be applied to submitting models for both environmental chemicals and pharma- ceuticals. This template is also a good starting point for the develop- ment of a new OECD Harmonized Template (OHT) (http://www.oecd. org/ehs/templates) to report PBPK models for chemical risk assessment and regulatory uses. This template has additional contexts of use beyond the regulatory sphere, including submitting and sharing PBPK-related studies (for ex- ample, for peer-reviewed publication or scientific collaborations), en- suring transparent communication between reviewers and model de- velopers, and training for new modelers and decision makers. Using this template will help standardize PBPK model reporting and commu- nication and thereby enhance their application and regulatory accep- tance.

This may include lack of compliance with PPE and hand-washing post- application, which may have contributed to possible contamination of collected urine samples with dermal residues of the test material. Given the availability of human toxicokinetic data (and no adverse effects observed at the dose levels tested), the 10x uncertainty factor for in- terspecies differences in ADME could be reduced (EFSA, 2006). Thus the AOEL could potentially be raised tenfold from 5.0 to 50.0 \u03bcg/kg bw/day. There are several limitations to this risk assessment conducted for operators. Firstly, in vitro measures of the skin permeability coefficient (distinct from basolateral membrane permeability) are required for haloxyfop-methyl ester, and should be compared with posterior values in Table 1 in order to further validate the dermal absorption model as calibrated. This may affect estimates for the fraction of haloxyfop me- thyl-ester absorbed through the skin, and improve the agreement with previously calculated values (Nolan et al., 1985). Secondly, the NOAEL of 500 \u03bcg/kg on which the AOEL is based (Barna-Lloyd et al., 1983, 1984) may not be the \u2018true\u2019 NOAEL. There may be doses above the NOAEL which do not elicit toxicity, but are still below the lowest ob- served adverse effect level (LOAEL), hence the true NOAEL is likely to be higher than 500 \u03bcg/kg bw. Benchmark dosing might be useful to identify possible ranges of the \u2018true\u2019 NOAEL (Filipsson et al., 2003). Lastly, the variability of operator HBM data under working conditions may not be fully explained by the choice of distributions used in the PBTK model. Further work should consider changes to cardiac output under the expected levels of physical exertion and sweat production which may influence dermal absorption.", "Acknowledgement": "Acknowledgements The research was funded by the National Institute for Health Research Health Protection Research Unit (NIHR HPRU) in Health Impact of Environmental Hazards at King's College London in part- nership with Public Health England and Imperial College London.

Perhaps most troubling is that the unreliable information on fish consumption, with all of its uncertainties and lack of ad- equate controls, was assigned quantitative precision in statistical evaluations of subjective neurodevelopmen- tal observations in newborns classified as exposed or nonexposed. These serious limitations in quantifying PCB ex- posure suggest that the fish consumption histories were inaccurate or that the weighted, generalized fish scheme employed for estimating PCB levels in fish was invalid. Both of these explanations of the weak corre- lations may in fact be true. Logically, it follows then that none of the reported correlations between fish con- sumption rates and any purported neurodevelopmental effect in these studies can be considered reliable.

The Task Group authors were provided with specific and general comments from appropriately qualified experts to better develop and support their proposed method. Multiple aspects ensure the robustness of the process: development of a comprehensive and objective list of charge questions, selection of qualified experts with appropriate backgrounds, maintenance of independence from the sponsors and authors, and attention to transparency so that others may judge the quality of the process and the results. Suggestions were gath- ered in a formal and organized way to assist the Task Group authors\u2019 efforts to improve their method and ensure its scientific soundness/defensibility. This project and peer consultation dem- onstrate the value of formal engagement of peers in development of new scientific methods and approaches. The development and implementation of such peer input approaches is likely to have a large potential impact on chemical hazard and risk assessments. The need to develop robust mechanisms to vet and validate alter- native methods for developing assessments with limited data sets has been a key focus of regulatory toxicologists. By conducting a public and transparent peer consultation, the scientific and regula- tory communities can better judge the quality and objectivity of the results.

Exposure to the AAD-1 pro- tein is also not expected to cause adverse health or nutritional ef- fects due to the digestive lability of the protein, its mode of action (catalysis of the oxygenolytic cleavage of 2,4-D to non-herbicidal dichlorophenol and glyoxylate via an Fe(II)/a-keto acid-dependent dioxygenase reaction), and a lack of adverse effects in mammalian toxicology studies (Embrey and Korjagin, 2008; Thomas and Mar- shall, 2010; Wiescinski and Golden, 2007; Wright et al., 2010); however, the lack of adverse effects of the AAD-1 protein on broiler chickens supports the overall human safety assessment. Human ingestion of raw maize is negligible (Rooney and Serna-Saldivar, 1999) and cooking will denature and inactivate the AAD-1 protein since it is labile at temperature as low as 50 \ufffdC (Schafer, 2008). Thus, human ingestion of the active AAD-1 protein is expected to be negligible. In this study, broiler chicks were continuously ex- posed to P0.52 ppm of the AAD-1 protein in their diet for 42 days (over which time the birds\u2019 average weight increased over 60-fold) without exhibiting adverse symptoms or nutritional deficiencies. The absence of adverse effects in this study supports the dietary safety of the AAD-1 protein expressed in event DAS-40278-9 maize.

Ideally, reference substances selected for PS should have multiple test results for each substance, and the results should be sufficiently reproducible that there are concor- dant classification outcomes. Alongside this, it is necessary to rec- ognize the variability of the standard assay with borderline substances and although desirable, not to require that an alterna- tive exceed that level of performance. Such selection and assess- ment criteria will nevertheless need to be balanced with the need to determine the capability of the new test method to prop- erly identify weakly positive and weakly negative substances. 5.

On the other hand, the increase in the plasma concentration of nicotine with PNCIT use was slower than that with conventional cigarettes smoking, suggesting that the nic- otine absorption sites in the respiratory system were different in addition to the differences in the duration of the aspiration or puff time set for the study regimen for the two products. The elimina- tion half-lives of nicotine for each test tobacco product suggest that the elimination of nicotine from blood is not affected significantly by the difference in the nicotine absorption sites.

The mean \u00b1 SD area under the concentration\u2013time curve from time zero to 48 h (AUC0\u2013t), the maximum concentration of melamine in plasma (Cmax), the time to maximum concentration (Tmax) and the half-life of melamine in plasma (t1/2) were successfully determined. This study sug- gested that melamine undergoes rapid absorption, then is distrib- uted and cleared from plasma, and subsequently excreted primarily in the urine. A clear background level of cyanuric acid was observed in plasma and urine of rhesus monkeys even in the absence of melamine exposure.

This provides the pharmacokinetic rationale for clinical studies to test this combination therapy in patients with hypertension. An improved pharmacodynamic characteristic of metoprolol succinate and telmisartan was established resulting in enhanced antihypertensive potential of metoprolol succinate in combination with telmisartan as compared to the metoprolol succinate and telmisartan alone. Although there were significant changes in some of the hematology, serum biochemistry parame- ters following changes in liver and stomach physiology observed in oral repeated dose 28-day toxicity study in Wistar albino rat in high dose level groups but they were transient and reversible as well as no occurrence of additive toxic effects due to concomi- tant administration. Moreover, no observed adverse effect levels (NOAELs) were at the low dose levels of each group was observed. Finally, as the target is to dispense 23.75 mg metoprolol succinate along with 20 mg telmisartan to treat patients with hypertension through once daily dosing, it can be concluded from findings of the present study that metoprolol succinate\u2013telmisartan should be efficacious and relatively safe to a greater extent in combination although risk benefit ratio should be assessed following long-term toxicity studies in order to rule out long-term adverse effect of the combination.

For organophosphorus pesticides dependent on renal clearance, a general factor of 10 could be applied to allow for species differences in toxicokinetics (contributing a factor of 4) and toxicodynamics (contributing a fac- tor of 2.5) (Renwick, 1993). On the other hand, for organophospho- rus pesticides dependent on liver clearance, such as chlorpyrifos, an additional toxicokinetic factor will be required in the derivation of safety factors as a result of their slow metabolic clearances. In this study, to support work by regulatory and industrial research- ers, simplified PBPK models for the organophosphorus pesticides acephate and chlorpyrifos and their primary metabolites were developed using a combination of algorithms, in vivo experimenta- tion with chimeric mice with humanized livers, and literature resources. According to the current PBPK analysis, acephate cleared similarly from plasma in humans and mice, but accidental/ incidental overdose levels of chlorpyrifos cleared more slowly from plasma in humans than it did in mice because its clearance is dependent on liver metabolism. The current data presented here illustrate how chimeric mice transplanted with human hepatocytes in combination with a simple PBPK model can assist evaluations of toxicological potential with respect to organophos- phorus pesticides acephate and chlorpyrifos.

However, except for alcohol and tobacco, no solid data about drug related public health care costs (hospital care, general health care) are available. The main reasons for the lack of such data are: (1) the insufficient knowledge on polydrug use, which flaws putative asso- ciations and causality between the use of a certain drug and the disease(s) resulting from it, and (2) the poorly known history of drug use (frequency, dose, duration of use) of the patient suffering from the disease. Finally, the prevalence of use of most illicit drugs in the general population is too low to provide enough power to ascertain statistically significant associations.

It thus seems intuitive that if chemicals are to have a chance to disrupt natural endocrine signals, their doses/concentrations and potencies ought to be sim- ilar to or stronger than the natural hormones (Dietrich, 2010; Gold- en et al., 1998; Marty et al., 2011). This strength of potency and amount defines a minimum requirement for influencing endocrine activity, which implies that defining either an endocrine hazard or a potential therapeutic effect requires an evaluation of potency and physiologically achievable concentrations. These principles have successfully guided endocrine pharmacology (Cleve et al., 2012), wherein it is recognized that natural hormones and their specific modifiers are already present at concentrations that occupy the available cellular receptors and are well controlled to support nor- mal physiological functioning. A reasoned assessment of the mech- anisms of hormone signaling and processing shows that safe levels of exposure can be set for endocrine active substances based on biological and pharmaceutical principles, the empirical data on the doses at which adverse effects can be observed, and an appro- priate degree of conservatism (Borgert et al., 2012; Caldwell et al., 2012).

The strong allergen PNA or OVA induced anti- gen-specific IgG2a and IgE. The weak allergen PAP induced lower and later antigen-specific IgG2a and IgE. Cry1C protein-sensitized rats had no antigen-specific IgG2a or IgE. In PNA-treated rats, IgE- mediated allergy was indicated by increased histamine levels immediately following PNA stimulation and increased numbers of mast cells. Additionally, PNA or OVA-sensitized rats had eosinophils in the intestinal villi clearance and intestinal glands clearance. In contrast to the other protein groups tested, the Cry1C group showed no allergy symptoms. Thus, we conclude that Cry1C does not appear to be more allergenic than PAP, and that it is safe to use in food or animal feed. This result is consistent with our earlier conclusions (Cao et al., 2010). In this study, we used several ways to determine the allergenicity of a new protein. These methods could be verified with each other. Additionally, various proteins known to have dif- ferent allergenic properties were employed to judge the strength of Cry1C protein sensitization. This technique provides a new meth- odology to assess GM food allergenicity. 6. Conflict of interest The authors declare that there are no conflicts of interest.
