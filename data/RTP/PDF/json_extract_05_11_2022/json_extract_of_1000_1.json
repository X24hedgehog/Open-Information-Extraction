This analytical method did not allow for direct determina- tion of the tin moieties. Deficiencies of this GC method were attributed to interference between the DOTE derived EHTG and EH, which had almost the same retention time. Additionally, both EHTG and EH peaks were asymmetrical (\u201ctailing\u201d) and inflated the sum of the peak areas. Thioglycolic acid (TGA), another breakdown product of EHTG, was not accounted for, further exaggerating the total. The inference from the chemical data, that DOTE hydrolyzed to dio- ctyltin dichloride (DOTC), was not correct. Read-across, supported primarily by the chemical data from simulated gastric hydrolysis studies in aqueous media, was used to place untested DOTE on a list of Substances of Very High Concern [SVHC] and classify it as toxic for reproduction, EU Category 1 B (ECHA, 2012). This toxicological extrapolation to DOTE was sup- ported by studies with the structural surrogates DOTI and DOTC which were read-across to DOTE. The experimental results presented here on both the simulated gastric hydrolysis studies in aqueous media and developmental toxicity studies in two sensitive species challenge the application of the read-across in this case. Therefore, the classification of DOTE as a Category 1 B reproductive toxicant, derived via the read-across, needs to be re-examined and possibly amended. The developmental toxicology research with dioctyltin sub- stances has indicated that dioctyltin thioesters are not develop- mentally toxic in rats (Battenfeld, 1991). However, a previous study withmixtures of mono- and dioctyltins in rabbits (Battenfeld,1992) indicated that DOTI/MOTI 80/20% caused an increased incidence of abortions, compromised gestational integrity, fetal weight reduc- tion, and an increased incidences of minor visceral and skeletal anomalies. The study was compromised by a diagnosis of pneu- monia or enteritis which killed some animals during the study. During dosing there was bloody vaginal outflow in the mid and high dose and one abortion in the high dose, both indicative of maternal toxicity in this species. The observed adverse effects in rabbits with DOTI may be unique to that substance or, quite possibly, the result of compromised maternal health during gestation. In mice, published data with the same DOTI/MOTI mixture (Faqi et al., 2001) were reported to cause an increased incidence of cleft palate and other skeletal anomalies at a mater- nally toxic dose. Previous reproductive studies with dioctyltin dichloride [DOTC] that is not a thioester substance and is more chemically active than DOTE, reported no incidences of malformed pups at birth but observed increased incidences of post- implantation and post-natal loss at maternally toxic doses. There was no evidence of an adverse effect on mating, fertility, or fecundity in any of the studies with dioctyltin substances. Collectively, the rabbit and mouse studies with DOTE reported here support the conclusion that DOTE is not teratogenic nor is it a developmental toxicant in these species. Studies with rats were not conducted because existing data indicate rats were refractive to adverse developmental effects with DOTI. A weight-of-evidence R.D. Costlow et al. / Regulatory Toxicology and Pharmacology 87 (2017) 23e29 29 assessment of these data suggests DOTE likely has different reproductive outcomes than the DOTI/MOTI mixtures. When compared to the WHO GHS classification criteria, the weight-of- evidence assessment in conjunction with the implications of the change in the simulated gastric hydrolysis strongly support a conclusion that DOTE should not be classified as a developmental toxicant.

When compared to the WHO GHS classification criteria, the weight-of- evidence assessment in conjunction with the implications of the change in the simulated gastric hydrolysis strongly support a conclusion that DOTE should not be classified as a developmental toxicant.

Hays et al. / Regulatory Toxicology and Pharmacology 64 (2012) 481\u2013489 489 scenarios. The biomonitoring data for 2,4-D provide evidence to support the substantial conservatism present in these external exposure modeling efforts, which should increase confidence that the safety assessment evaluations conducted by USEPA are indeed protective. These data also suggest that refinements to the regula- tory exposure and safety assessment processes might be appropri- ate. In particular, presentation of central tendency estimates for chronic exposures rather than upper bound estimates, and using actual water monitoring data en lieu of modeling that consistently overestimates the measurements might be warranted (Jackson et al., 2005). Because modeled dietary exposure appears to be a major contributor to aggregate dose, the biomonitoring estimates suggest that the model could be further refined to reflect losses due to storage and processing that occurs between the point of measurement and exposure \u2018\u2018at the fork\u2019\u2019. Additionally, low-end exposure estimates, with a characterization of the likely variation over time for individuals and over different exposure assumptions, could provide a more balanced picture of potential risks under a wider range of use and residue conditions.

Elevated levels of molybdenum and copper were found in the serum, blood, liver and kidneys of rats treated with 60 mg Mo/kgbw/day. Lower doses of 5 and 17 mg Mo/kgbw/day did not cause any treatment-related toxicity. No treatment-related adverse effects on the reproductive organ weights or histopathology, estrus cycles or sperm parame- ters were observed at any dose level. Thus, the NOAEL for molyb- denum in male and female rats was determined to be 17 mg Mo/ kgbw/day based on effects on reduced body weight gain in males and females, and renal effects in two females at 60 mg Mo/kgbw/ day. The NOAEL for gonadal, sperm and estrus cycle effects was 60 mg Mo/kgbw/day.

The only effect of NRCPI noted at the dietary levels of 10% (males only) and 20% was evidenced by statistically significant lower body weight gains for the entire duration of the study, which was most probably due to the palatability of the test material. In spite of lower body weight gains, the mean body weights of all NRCPI-treated groups were within WIL\u2019s historical control range. The reduction in body weight gains coincided with reduced food consumption during most of the study for the 10% test article treated males and 20% test article treated males and females. Therefore, the lower weight gain in the 10 and 20% test article-treated groups was not considered an adverse event. Based on this information, it was estimated that the no-ob- served-effect level (NOEL) for dietary administration of the NRCPI to Sprague Dawley Crl:CD(SD) rats for 13 weeks was 5% w/w. Fur- thermore, the no-observed-adverse-effect level (NOAEL) was the highest dose tested of 20% w/w, equivalent to 12.46 g/kg BW/day for males and 14.95 g/kg BW/day for females. Under the conditions of the present study, the NRCPI is considered safe. Conflict of interest statement L.A. Mejia, P.S. Williamson-Hughes, R. Grabiel and M.

Specifi- cally, data was needed to investigate the renal toxicity of melamine and cyanuric acid combined because of the physical blockage of re- nal tubules created by co-precipitation. In this study, we found a level of melamine and cyanuric acid at which male weanling pigs did not form renal crystals. The NOAEL is 1 mg/kg bw/day, which corresponds to 25 mg/kg dry weight (ppm) in the feed. This data, including a safety factor of 10, supports the levels of no concern set in risk assessments prepared worldwide for human food as well as for infant formula.

(2011), shows a statistical association between CPF exposure and measures of intelligence that is at odds with the determination of cholinesterase inhibition as the critical effect by numerous authorities. This study raises a number of challenges due in part to the absence of data to confirm findings and the reluctance by the authors to share these data, suitably anonymized, despite multiple requests by several groups and despite public funding in part. An analysis of the published figures of Rauh et al. (2011) shows that up to 35% of the data appear to be missing, and that the associations are lessened or no longer apparent when different logarithmic assumptions were used in the reanalysis. This lack of transparency makes it difficult to confirm this study's findings and raises serious scientific doubt about the use of such data in public decisions.

Acknowledgments 5 Conclusion Funding source Conflict of interest Acknowledgments References", "Funding": "The weight of evidence from rodent studies, mechanistic inves- tigations, human clinical observations, and epidemiology studies supports the conclusion that the mode of action leading to the tumors seen in the rat CaBio was necrosis and compensatory cell proliferation in the presence of chronic inflammation of the repro- ductive tract, brought about by the high, toxic doses of quinacrine- plus-methylcellulose. Tumors were not produced in the absence of these chronic toxicities. Based on the different mode of quinacrine administration (pellets instead of methylcellulose slurry) and the absence of chronic toxicity and tumors in women receiving QS, it can be concluded that the mode of action of tumor induction in the rat is not relevant to its use in women undergoing permanent contraception with quinacrine. This conclusion is supported by the human epidemiology studies that have demonstrated no increase in reproductive tract tumors in women who have received QS treatment compared to women using other forms of contraception. Funding source International Services Assistance Fund (ISAF) sponsored this research. ISAF provided editorial and technical support during the article\u2019s preparation, and suggested the journal for potential publication. 5 Conclusion Funding source Conflict of interest Acknowledgments References", "Acknowledgement": "Acknowledgments The authors are grateful to Family Health International, the sponsor of the rodent carcinogenesis studies, for providing the original laboratory reports and other information related to the conduct of the studies.

However, federal agencies, states, cities, and counties have passed various forms of \u2018\u2018green legislation\u201d (Rosenberg, 2008). Although specific requirements for establishing and maintaining an environmental sustainability program are not currently man- dated by government regulation, components of sustainability are beginning to reach the legislative floor. Companies may soon be forced to compete on the basis of their ability to effectively manufacture, market, and recycle their product in an environmen- tally responsible manner (Schneider, 2009; Lubin and Esty, 2010). Existing or proposed federal, state, local government regulatory or voluntary programs may foreshadow numerous possible sustain- ability legislative changes. Furthermore, voluntary initiatives, such as LEED requirements, banning specific chemicals, or potential TSCA reform mandating the elimination of various chemicals, may eliminate the need for a government bureaucracy to be estab- lished to monitor the success of firms in this area. However, should a patchwork of regulations or expectations be established, those companies that have not proactively established sustainable prac- tices may be faced with compliance issues instead of just commu- nity or stakeholder pressures. Those companies interested in designing and implementing sustainability programs can benefit from the past 20 or more years of initiatives, since much headway has been made in many indus- tries. ISO, DJennifer SahmelI, and UShannon GaffneyBC help frame sustainable practices in a voluntary manner, but in the United States, we expect that when the current recession eases, there will be more standardization about the need for various corporations to achieve certain mile- stones. It is unclear which federal, state, or local agency will lead the charge toward standardizing and regulating environmentally sustainable behavior; however a recent memorandum from the EPA Office of Research and Development stated that \u2018\u2018the goal of sustainability is [EPA\u2019s] true north,\u201d which suggests a commitment to sustainability goals (EPA, 2010b). EPA\u2019s efforts may foreshadow a larger role in the future of sustainability regulation."}},

Indeed, the correlation of the po- tency test itself to clinical safety and efficacy has not been firmly established (Smythe et al., 2010). Our animal modeling results indicate that the second stage USP monograph change may result in detectable decreases in anticoagulant test responses across a population but the variability within individual responses and the relatively small decrease in the anticoagulant response do not support a proposal to uniformly increase doses of the \u2018\u2018new\u2019\u2019 UFH. Although we evaluated only one dosing regimen, similar find- ings (detectable decreases in anticoagulant test responses across a population but variability within individual responses) are ex- pected for the many different types of UFH dosing regimens used clinically. These data underscore the importance of individualiza- tion of UFH doses based upon the results of anticoagulation test re- sults, therapeutic goals and the recommended dose regimens. 5.

Such a tool would facilitate a guided weight of evidence assessment for rodent carcinogens which are also genotoxic on the basis of available experiment data coupled with predicted out- comes from TIMES models. Extending the chemical dataset to include chemicals from the chemical classes of heteroaromatics, nitroaromatics, phenols and aromatic amines is of high priority. Efforts to account for test sex and species differences will also be investigated.

Some risk factors applied to all or several subtypes (such as low-level education and living on a farm), while others were lim- ited to one or two specific subtypes (such as home/workplace ren- ovation and APL). An inverse association was found between BMI and overall AML or the sub-category \u2018\u2018AML not otherwise catego- rized\u201d, whereas a positive association between BMI and the sub- type APL was detected. The difference in risk by subtype underscores the importance of investigating the etiologic com- monality and heterogeneity of AML subtypes. An unexpected find- ing was the association between the use of traditional Chinese medicines and a reduced risk of AML in general as well as several major subtypes. Acknowledgments This case-control study is part of the Shanghai Health Study (SHS) program, a collaborative effort between investigators in the US and China, involving several organizations in both countries. First and foremost, we express our gratitude to the 29 participating hospitals in Shanghai and the patients at these hospitals who con- sented to participate in our study. This study could not have been possible without the contributions from these hospitals or patients to the study. We are indebted to the Joint Sino-US Clinical and Molecular Laboratory (JCML) team for the diagnostic and question- naire information (in particular, Dr. Richard Irons, Dr. Sherilyn Gross, Gail Jorgensen and Chen Xiaobao) and the exposure assess- ment team for exposure information (in particular, Dr. Thomas Armstrong, Dr. Jin Xipeng, Dr. Liang Youxin, Zhou Yimei and Zhang Chi). We are grateful to the data collection team at the Fudan Uni- versity School of Public Health (in particular, Dr. Ye Xibiao). We would like to thank our collaborators in Shanghai for their gener- osity in sharing their exposure data with us: the Shanghai Munici- pal Center for Diseases Control and Prevention, the Shanghai Municipal Institute of Public Health Supervision, and other District Institutes of Public Health Supervision. We would like to express our sincere thanks to the Scientific Review Panel and the Ethics Re- view Panel of the SHS program for their encouragement and guid- ance throughout the project. Finally, we would like to express our appreciation to the Benzene Health Effects Consortium for support- ing the study and to the staff at the American Petroleum Institute (in particular, Dr. Russel White) for administrative supports in coordinating our interactions with the Scientific Review Panel, the Ethics Review Panel and the sponsor.

The tool might also facilitate identification of alternative methods that, if placed into integrated testing strategies, supplement in vivo re- search and may help to identify new nano-relevant endpoints that are not yet covered by current chemical safety testing.

For all doses, systemic exposure to N6022 was 1.3- to 1.6-fold greater on Day 14 than on Day 1. Based upon the terminal half-lives observed on Study Day 1 (64.9 h), plasma accumulation ratios this large would not be expected on a once a day dosing regimen. Therefore, these data suggest a small reduction in plasma clearance of N6022 over the course of the 14-day study. Following the 50 mg/kg dose, satura- tion of plasma clearance was observed resulting in plasma expo- sures to drug significantly greater than would be predicted by the 2.0 and 10 mg/kg doses. Furthermore, the steady state volume of distribution (Vss) following the 50 mg/kg dose was substantially lower for animals receiving the 50 mg/kg dose indicating a satura- tion of distribution as well. Finally, plasma protein binding studies indicate that a substantial increase in the unbound fraction would be expected following the 50 mg/kg dose until the plasma concen- trations approached 41 lg/mL (100 lM). The finding of the liver as a target organ of toxicity is consistent with it being the primary organ of elimination of N6022. Although N6022 was largely excreted as unchanged drug in bile, glucuroni- dation was identified as the major metabolic pathway. While mul- tiple glucuronidation sites within N6022 are feasible, the isolation of five N6022-glucuronids peaks is consistent with migration of an initial N6022-b-1-O-acyl-glucuronide conjugate as would be ex- pected based on the structure of N6022 (Fig. 1). Acyl-glucuronides are known to be reactive and may form protein adducts by glyca- tion or transacylation reactions (for review see Stachulski, 2010; Regan et al., 2010). Reactive acyl-glucuronides can also form thio- esters with GSH (Grillo and Hua, 2003) or acyl coenzyme A (Regan et al., 2010 and references therein). Hepatoxicities related to acyl- glucuronides, in particular of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, include hepatocellular necrosis, cholestasis, steatosis, and autoimmune chronic active hepatitis (Boelsterli et al., 1995; Lewis 1998). The potential role, if any, of N6022-glucuronide in the lone animal observed with liver toxicity remains to be determined.

By using measured, Bayesian-fit and adjustable model parameters, this modeling work allowed for inter- and intra-human variability in influential model parameters, which is more realistic than using mean values taken from the literature. We found that there was large inter-individ- ual variability in these parameters, which would lead to large inter-subject differences in internal dose and duration of dose. This work further illustrated that the toxicokinetics and actual body burden of airborne solvents varies among equivalently exposed individu- als. While our study was done with healthy Caucasian men exposed at rest, additional inter-individual vari- ability is expected with women, different ethnic groups, working conditions, and those with pathological vari- ables (Langman, 1994; and Jang and Droz, 1997). For these reasons, airborne concentrations are impre- cise indicators of the actual toxicological dose and duration of internal exposure. An improvement is the use of Biological Exposure Indexes (BEIs), which rep- resent the levels of toxicants in worker specimens such as breath, urine, or blood. Such indexes should include inter-individual kinetic variability, as assessed in our study of xylenes, to best protect working and environ- mentally exposed populations.

That is because people treated for one age-related disease often goes on to die from another relatively soon thereafter. \u201cWhat we want to show is that if we delay ageing, that's the best way to delay disease.\u201d (Check Hayden, 2015) Recently, it was announced an ambition project of clinical trial called Tu\u011fba AdakME (Targeting Aging with Metformin) proposed by Nir Barzilai and colleagues (Check Hayden, 2015; Hall, 2015). They are going to give MET during 5\u20137 years to 3000 people aged 70\u201380 years who already has one or two of three age-associated diseases (heart disease, cancer, cognitive decline). They will give the drug MET to thousands of people who already have one or two of three conditions\u2014cancer, heart disease or cognitive impairment\u2014or are at risk of them. People with T2DM cannot be enrolled because MET is already used to treat that disease. The participants will then be monitored to see whether the medication forestalls the illnesses they do not already have, as well as diabetes and death. On 24 June, researchers will try to convince FDA officials that if the trial succeeds, they will have proved that a drug can delay ageing. That would set a precedent that ageing is a disorder that can be treated with medicines, and perhaps spur progress and funding for ageing re- search (Check Hayden, 2015). From this viewpoint, Bannister et al. have done a research with patients in 2014 (Bannister et al., 2014). Bannister and his colleagues use retrospective observational data from UK Clinical Practice Research Datalink (CPRD) from 2000. The people who have T2DM and use MET or sulphonylureas (SU) as first-line treatment were selected. In this research, 78,241 subjects were treated with MET, 12,222 were treated with SU, and 90,463 were non-diabetic people. As findings, there were 7498 deaths in total, representing unadjusted mortality rates of 14.4 and 15.2, and 50.9 and 28.7 deaths per 1000 person-years for met- formin monotherapy and their matched controls, and sulphonylurea monotherapy and their matched controls, respectively. As a conclusion of this study, patients with T2DM initiated with MET monotherapy had a longer survival than did matched, non-diabetic controls. On the other hand, those treated with SU had markedly reduced survival comparing with both matched controls and those receiving MET monotherapy."}},

It can be argued from a scientific point of view that potency assessment for reproductive toxicity potency is not possible due to the extreme complexity of this hazard class. Also the way to take the potency into account, as proposed in this paper, could be considered as scientifically imperfect and crude. However, from a regulatory point of view, taking into account the extremely wide range of potency range identified, it is advisable to take this information into account. On the basis of the results of the databases, a proposal containing guidance for potency classes and associated SCLs based on the potency range of the ED10 for effects warranting classifica- tion has been developed and is currently (i.e. 2012) under regula- tory discussion. Deriving borders for potency classes and connected SCLs for substances classified as reproductive toxicants is more or less arbitrary and can only be a policy decision. With respect to structure, this proposal is in close analogy to the struc- ture of the guidance for carcinogenicity, i.e. the T25 concept (Sanner et al., 2001). Roughly, it assigns substances to three potency categories (high, medium, low) both for developmental toxicity and for he impairment of fertility.

Purkis et al. / Regulatory Toxicology and Pharmacology 56 (2010) 365\u2013373 ing smoking. Differences due to the smoking process are difficult to identify but are often reflected in different puff numbers. The UK Government and cigarette manufacturers established a leading position in smoke analysis, instituted over many years, be- cause of their expertise and the quality of generated data. Proce- dures were set up to monitor the tar yield reduction programme and subsequently to monitor compliance with pack labelling regu- lations. Problems with tar and nicotine measurement in the UK have been successfully dealt with through a rigorous monitoring procedure backed up by close liaison between the GAL and the TMA member companies through the expert SLWG committee. Without the continual sharing of data, the correct and accurate interpretation of smoke data will become more difficult and could lead to a higher rate of \u2018\u2018apparent\u201d non-compliance. Under the Framework Convention on Tobacco Control, the Con- ference of the Parties has requested the development of a new ma- chine smoking method for cigarettes and the measurement of S.W. Purkis et al. / Regulatory Toxicology and Pharmacology 56 (2010) 365\u2013373 373 additional smoke constituents to the three currently subject to reg- ulation i.e. tar, nicotine and carbon monoxide. When these meth- ods are finalised, it will be necessary to establish a tolerance for each new smoke analyte under any new or existing smoking method. The historical UK surveys of cigarette machine yields of NFDPM, nicotine and CO are an example of a formal process that is based on robust measurement that can benefit both regulators and manu- facturers. A forum to discuss smoke yields both before and after introduction of any new regulation provides early notification of any methodological problems or unclear interpretations, potential issues to be addressed or modified within the standardisation pro- cess. It also provides an indication of real or apparent non-compli- ances to allow both manufacturers an opportunity to modify products, and the Government testing laboratory to modify testing procedures if there are discrepancies. This requires a transparent, documented process. The forum is not intended as a means to de- fend non-compliance but rather as a means of ensuring that man- ufacturers and regulators can provide robust data that are accepted by all parties. 5.

Through this tool it is possible to make various decisions and build an integrated testing strategy, including consideration of EBW. By integration in a web-based tool, the EBW approach is readily available and easy to use for all stakeholders. Unfortu- nately, there is no integrated testing strategy yet for carcinogenic- ity and reproductive toxicity in the webtool. Perhaps a future extension of the tool will also include these endpoints. Until that time the version of the decision tree in this paper can already be used by those who want to consider EBW for these endpoints. 6.

Shepperd et al. / Regulatory Toxicology and Pharmacology 55 (2009) 97\u2013109 The St. Charles et al., 2006 study was also conducted in a clinical environment and incorporated accurate recording of cigarette con- sumption, accurate sample collection and compliance with the protocol. However, the majority of the published correlation stud- ies were ambulatory studies and didn\u2019t incorporate the features listed above. Very few researchers have assessed the effect of cigarette FTC/ ISO tar yield on biomarkers of exposure of tar constituents other than nicotine. Hecht et al. (2005) used an ambulatory approach to investigate the uptake of nicotine and the tobacco smoke lung carcinogens, NNK and pyrene in smokers of US regular, light and ultralight cigarettes. Smokers provided spot urine samples during ambulatory visits and self reported cigarette consumption. It was concluded that there was no correlation between FTC tar levels and any of the biomarkers. Therefore, the current design targeted smokers of yet more spe- cific tar yields to provide discrete levels akin to a set of analytical standards with which to evaluate the methods. In so doing, the variability has been reduced to such a level that the groups can be separated statistically. In addition, adopting the clinical ap- proach has permitted the tighter experimental controls to ensure subject compliance, accurate and complete sample collection and limitation of interferences by control of diet and medication. In conclusion, this study has shown that estimates of exposure obtained by filter analysis and biomarkers of exposure are corre- lated over a wide range of smoke exposures. Whilst biomarkers of exposure are the generally more accepted approach for estimat- ing human smoke exposure, filter analysis may provide a simple and effective alternative as well as evaluation of alternative ma- chine smoking methods, smoke exposure estimation in large scale studies and, in particular, the evaluation of candidate cigarette- based PREPs. Therefore, a combination of the two approaches used in this study could provide a good framework for the assessment of con- ventional cigarettes and PREPS, with small scale biomarker studies providing data on the mechanisms of exposure reduction and filter analysis studies providing normal \u2018in-use\u2019 data from large scale field studies.", "Acknowledgement": "Acknowledgments We thank Dr Gerhard Scherer and Dr Kelley St. Charles for their input into study design, Pamela Saunders and Madeleine Ashley for their contribution to the filter analysis and Dr Christopher Proctor, Dr David O\u2019Reilly, Dr Eian Massey and John McAughey for contribu- tions to the draft manuscript.

Excessive salivation and intermittent soft feces were found in both sexes at 1000 or 2000 mg/kg bw/day, which may be caused by RD-wE but are not serious enough to be categorized as adverse effects. Under the experimental conditions no observed adverse effect level (NOAEL) was considered to be 2000 mg/kg bw/day in both sexes. Target organs for RD-wE were not determined in this study.

An ap- proach is described for how the quality of human data can be systematically assessed.

The approach mirrors the data quality categories established by Klimisch et al. for two principal reasons; to establish a system of human data evaluation and description that comple- ments that already applied to animal studies and, when appropri- ate, helps facilitate transparent (and repeatable) weight of evidence comparisons. A definition of quality is proposed that en- ables human studies to be evaluated and described (for IUCLID en- tries) in a manner that accounts both for absolute quality and interpretability and hence enables human health risk assessments to consistently and transparently incorporate the human experience.

The resulting delive- rables can also be included in various portions of an Ivan RusynIS Toxicolog- ical Review, with evidence tables and short narrative summaries in the primary body of the document, and search strategies, literature trees, and assessment criteria included in an appendix. Online re- sources such as the HERO database can also be utilized to capture study information, with all of the literature considered in the assessment classified in accordance with inclusion and exclusion criteria. Our process also allows for expert evaluation of results at every stage, a critical component to conduct an interpretation of the relevance of results to the assessment process. Ultimately, this systematic approach to literature retrieval, selection, and pre- sentation of studies effectively manages a large volume of litera- ture, improves transparency, and facilitates synthesis of critical information (e.g., regarding hepatocarcinogenicity mechanism of action) in human health assessments.

McNamee et al. / Regulatory Toxicology and Pharmacology 54 (2009) 197\u2013209 of the cosmetics industry to have validated in vitro assays available as soon as possible are addressed by parts 1 and 2 whilst the longer term need to have available in vitro assays based on a better under- standing of mechanisms of eye irritation is addressed by part 3 of the programme. Brief details of the approach and projects within the core ele- ments of the COLIPA programme are: 2.3.1.1. Method development/optimisation of existing models. The method development/optimisation of current in vitro assays within the COLIPA PT-SCAAT (Project Team of the Steering Committee on Alternatives to Animal Testing) eye irritation programme is fo- cused on Reconstructed human Tissue (RhT) models. Several RhT models are available with some being more advanced in both development and availability than others. \ufffd Two of the most advanced models currently available are the SkinEthicTM Human Corneal Epithelium (HCE) model (derived from Human Corneal Epithelium) and the MatTek EpiocularTM model (derived from human keratinocytes). Recent work on these models has been led by industry in collaboration with the test method developers to expand the data available for predictive capacity and reproducibility (within and between laboratories) using optimised protocols. COLIPA is now engaged with ECVAM in a formal validation study for these two RhT models. \ufffd Other RhT eye irritation models under development have reported improved barrier function capability over some of the commercially available models. COLIPA is engaged in under- standing whether use of barrier function as an endpoint is useful to measure in an RhT assay for evaluation of eye irritancy at the lower (non-irritant/very mild) end of the irritancy range. 2.3.1.2. Integrated analysis to define batteries of in vitro assays. All assays have specific domains of applicability whether this relates to range of irritancy or to types of chemical classes. If the deter- mined applicability domain does not fully cover the purpose of the safety assessment, combinations of assays are likely to be needed. Today, combinations of in vitro assays are used by individ- ual companies as an integral part of their safety assessments (see Section 4). Likewise, validation efforts focus increasingly on testing batteries since it is generally accepted that no single assay will fully replace the rabbit Draize eye test. 2.3.1.3. External collaboration. Equally important to achieve vali- dated in vitro methods is collaboration between industry, acade- mia, external scientific organisations and regulators. \ufffd COLIPA is working with ECVAM by active mutual participation in both COLIPA and ECVAM Eye Irritation Task Forces. \ufffd COLIPA is providing ECVAM with support for post hoc statistical analysis of current in vitro methods and development of approaches for integrated analysis to define batteries of in vitro assays via the funding of an independent biostatistician. This latter activity is further discussed in Section 2.3.3 below. 2.3.1.4. Research programme. Building on the experience of earlier validation studies and scientific workshops the research pro- gramme is focused on identification of in vitro endpoints related to the dynamics of injury and recovery that are more predictive for in vivo eye irritation effects that occur in humans. This will en- able the development of prediction models for pre-validation of new or improved in vitro methods that would proceed to formal validation. P. McNamee et al. / Regulatory Toxicology and Pharmacology 54 (2009) 197\u2013209 203 The original research programme, which is now completed, was composed of three integrated research projects: (1) development of an in vitro model of excised corneas maintained in culture to al- low observation of injury/recovery after chemical exposure to investigate whether kinetics/patterns of change in physiological function and signals of injury released from the cornea in vitro can predict a chemical\u2019s potential to damage the eye with a focus on recovery; (2) development of sequentially built bioengineered 3-D multi-layer corneal constructs consisting of epithelium, stro- ma and endothelium to better understand underlying mechanisms of action to enable identification of endpoints related to magnitude of injury and quality of repair in human immortalised cells and 3-D human conjunctival and corneal constructs; and (3) a preliminary genomics project using a pattern recognition approach to identify new endpoints for injury and repair that builds on corneal models for potential use in current/future in vitro assays. The goal of the research programme is to have available a model that measures depth of injury and recovery. As such, the ongoing work is focussed on continued development of multilayer corneal models such as isolated eyes, isolated corneas and 3-D bioengi- neered corneal constructs and incorporation of evaluation param- eters that measures depth of injury as this relates to extent of recovery. 2.3.2. In silico approaches Eye irritation is a difficult endpoint to model in silico because of the complexity of the biological mechanisms that may be involved (Maurer et al., 2002; Jester, 2006). Most approaches have therefore modelled eye irritation resulting from physical effects, such as pen- etration of the ocular tissues or corrosion. The most commonly used approaches have focused on the development of: (a) tradi- tional quantitative models (in which a measure of eye irritation po- tency is predicted); (b) classification models (in which a classification of eye irritation potential is predicted); (c) simulation of molecule-membrane interactions; (d) neural network models in which non-linear QSAR modelling techniques are employed; and e) expert system approaches (e.g., TOPKAT, the BfR rules for the pre- diction of skin irritation (BfR), Derek (LHASA Ltd) and TOPKAT). A Decision Support System (DSS) for the prediction of several toxico- logical endpoints has been developed by the German Bundesinsti- tut f\u00fcr Risikobewertung (BfR). With regard to the prediction of eye irritation/corrosion, the DSS contains 31 physicochemical exclu- sion rules based on molecular weight, octanol\u2013water partition coefficient, lipid/aqueous solubility and melting point, and 27 inclusion rules that define structural alerts potentially responsible for eye irritation and/or corrosion. A substructure is considered \u2018\u2018reactive\u201d based on the classification and labelling of the majority of its molecules (e.g., aliphatic monoalcohols) (Gerner et al., 2005; Tsakovska et al., 2007). This system was submitted to ECVAM for consideration to enter the validation process and is currently under review. 2.3.3. External validation oriented activities ECVAM organised in 2005 a workshop in which experts from aca- demia, industry and regulatory authorities developed an approach that uses in vitro assays in combination along with an understanding of physicochemical parameters to evaluate the eye irritation of a substance. This strategy is called the Bottom\u2013Up and Top\u2013Down ap- proach and was developed to be applicable to chemicals in general (Bottom\u2013Up and Top\u2013Down approach: Eye irritation testing strat- egy to reduce and replace in vivo studies. Scott et al., submitted for publication). It relies, as a first step, on using physicochemical parameters to predict whether a substance would be expected to be an eye irritant or not. This decision drives the choice of the first in vitro assay to be conducted. Substances predicted to be of no or low eye irritation potential would first be tested in an in vitro assay most suited to the detection of non or mild irritants whilst those pre- dicted to be severe eye irritants would first be tested in assays most suited for that purpose e.g., BCOP, ICE. This first in vitro assay is then followed by a second in vitro assay to confirm irritancy status of sub- stances identified as not severe in the Top/Down testing scenario and those identified as irritant in the Bottom/Up testing scenario. It is the combination of the two in vitro assays that can then be used to finally clarify the eye irritation potential and if needed regulatory classifica- tion of a substance (GHS category 1 and 2 (Globally Harmonised Sys- tem; a new legislation, recently approved to be implemented in the EU (EU, 2008)); R41, R36, NC according to the current EU classifica- tion system). In order to implement this approach, there is a need to have available a number of validated in vitro assays and a method of statistical analysis to determine the confidence of predictive capac- ity that can be derived from combinations of in vitro assays. A num- ber of activities are ongoing to address this in terms of: (1) new (RhT assays validation study) and (2) retrospective (currently available cell function and cytotoxicity assays (Cytosensor, Red Blood Cell (RBC), Neutral Red Release (NRR), Fluorescein Leakage (FL) review) validation activities of in vitro assays. These activities as they relate to the new and retrospective validation activities for in vitro assays are listed in Table 2. Furthermore development of the statistical tools to support this integrated analysis will need to occur. Along similar lines, the European Partnership on Alternative Ap- proaches to Animal Testing (EPAA) and ECVAM, in a joint effort, held a workshop (EPAA, 2008) on integrated testing strategies which started to address the validation of integrated testing strat- egies and included the application of integrated analysis for defini- tion of combinations of in vitro assays. 2.3.4. Other approaches Another approach that has been suggested is use of a \u2018\u2018Thresh- old of Toxicological Concern-like (TTC-like) approach\u201d. This refers to universal exposure thresholds of chemical exposure in general similar to the TTC approaches developed for systemic effects (Kroes et al., 2004, 2007). Whereas thresholds of concern are eval- uated by safety assessors for specific substances and products on a routine basis, a universal threshold concept has not been system- atically explored for eye irritation to date. 3. A tiered approach for eye irritation assessment 3.1. Decision tree for hazard assessment A decision tree for eye irritation hazard assessment is outlined in Fig. 1. This is a tiered iterative approach based on a number of steps. It should be noted that decisions in this tiered approach take into account both in vitro assays that already have regulatory acceptance and those that are described in the scientific literature and based on industry experience as being \u2018\u2018suitable for purpose\u201d. Such industry experience is typically based on individual company use of the in vitro assay with specific classes of chemicals that pro- vide confidence for its predictive capacity relative to the substance under evaluation. The different steps in the decision tree for hazard identification are as follows: Step 1: Perform a WoE evaluation of all available information, including for example physicochemical properties and \u2018read- across\u2019 to other structurally similar chemicals with known eye irri- tation potential to answer the question \u2018\u2018Is this substance likely to be corrosive to skin?\u201d. If the answer to this question is \u2018\u2018yes\u201d, the substance is considered as corrosive and by default, judged as a se- vere eye irritant. If the answer to this question is \u2018\u2018no\u201d, either con- sider it as a severe irritant as a worst case assumption, though not confirmed by testing, or proceed to Step 2. Fig. 1. Decision tree approach proposed to evaluate ingredients for hazard identification using alternative eye irritation assays. 204 P. McNamee et al. / Regulatory Toxicology and Pharmacology 54 (2009) 197\u2013209 Step 2: Conduct an organotypic assay listed in Table 1 to deter- mine whether the substance is a severe eye irritant to answer the question \u2018\u2018Is the severe eye irritancy of the substance confirmed?\u201d BCOP and ICE are organotypic assays for which both external vali- dation status and regulatory acceptance are already officially avail- able for their use to positively identify severe eye irritants. Other organotypic models, the HET-CAM and IRE assays, are also ac- cepted by EU authorities for the classification of severe irritants. If the outcome of the organotypic assay indicates that the sub- stance is a severe eye irritant, the result of Step 1 is confirmed. If the organotypic assay does not indicate severe eye irritancy of the substance, in-house company experience is needed to support prediction of irritancy levels of less than severe in order to move to Step 3. It is important to consider the expected mode of action of the test material. When evaluating the routine endpoints in the organotypic assays, histological observations can improve the interpretation. Step 3: Conduct an in vitro assay for eye irritation to answer the question \u2018\u2018Is the substance an eye irritant (less than severe)?\u201d. The choice of assay(s) need to take into account its applicability do- main and requires experience with the chemical class to be evalu- ated. The outcome of assay(s) in the WoE approach will indicate whether the substance is considered an eye irritant or not irritating to the eye. It should be noted that decisions in this tiered approach take into account assays that already have regulatory acceptance as well as those that are described in the scientific literature as being suitable and/or those that industry has experience with (in-house qualification). Regulatory acceptance information is included in the footnotes of Fig. 1. Tables 1 and 2 provide an overview of in vitro eye irritation as- says and their application based on peer-reviewed literature whilst Table 1 summarises the regulatory status of several of the assays. 3.2. Decision tree for safety assessment A decision tree for safety assessment of ingredients using alter- native eye irritation models is outlined in Fig. 2. As for hazard iden- Fig. 2. Decision tree approach proposed to evaluate ingredients identified as non-irritant, irritant or severe irritant (in Fig. 1) for safety assessment using alternative eye irritation models. P. McNamee et al. / Regulatory Toxicology and Pharmacology 54 (2009) 197\u2013209 205 tification, the safety assessment decision tree is based on a WoE approach. The starting point of the safety assessment for ingredi- ents in cosmetic products is hazard identification as presented in the decision tree detailed in Fig. 1. It should be noted that, as for hazard identification, decisions in this tiered approach for safety assessment of substances take into account both in vitro assays that already have regulatory accep- tance and those that are described in the scientific literature and based on industry experience as being suitable for purpose. Such in-house experience is typically based on individual company use of the in vitro assay with specific classes of chemicals that provide confidence for its predictive capacity relative to the material under evaluation. Very often, in vitro tests are performed with an ingredi- ent in the context of a formulation in order not only to obtain infor- mation on the neat ingredient, but at the same time on the irritant potential of the actual composition of ingredients. This involves use of a comparative approach in which benchmark products are included in the test. The different steps in the decision tree for safety assessment are as follows: 3.2.1. If the substance is identified as a severe eye irritant (Section 3.1) Step 1: Conduct an organotypic in vitro eye irritation assay listed in Table 1 on the diluted substance to answer the question \u2018\u2018Is the substance severely irritant at use concentration?\u201d. If the answer is \u2018\u2018yes\u201d, use of this substance at this specific concentra- tion in cosmetic products may not be possible. A severe irritant can also be tested at usage concentration in a formulation using organotypic in vitro eye irritation assay(s) to address that dilution and formulation effects may decrease the potential for eye irrita- tion or confirm that the substance in formulation remains a severe eye irritant. Formulations need to have an acceptably low eye irri- 206 P. McNamee et al. / Regulatory Toxicology and Pharmacology 54 (2009) 197\u2013209 tation profile to ensure product safety in use and through acciden- tal exposure. If the diluted chemical does not cause severe eye irritation, pro- ceed to Step 2. Step 2: Conduct further in vitro tests covering the irritancy range from non- to moderate irritant to answer the question \u2018\u2018Is the substance irritant or non-irritant at usage concentra- tion?\u201d. This may take the form of testing diluted substance alone or at usage concentration in formulation. The choice of assay(s) needs to take into account its applicability and requires experi- ence with the chemical class/formulation category to be evalu- ated. The outcome of assay(s) in the WoE approach will indicate whether the diluted substance/substance at usage con- centration in formulation is considered an eye irritant or not irri- tating to the eye. If the answer to this question is \u2018\u2018yes\u201d a comparison is made with benchmark substances/formulations to determine acceptability for continued development/marketing and whether additional eye irritant labelling measures are re- quired, or re-formulation needed. If the answer is \u2018\u2018no\u201d, no fur- ther evaluation is required. As mentioned above, decisions in this tiered approach take into account assays that already have regulatory acceptance as well as those that are described in the scientific literature as being suitable Table 3 Use examples based on information from 11 companies.

However, in many circumstances in which pesticides have been used in pest management, or where residual DPs persist on furni- ture, floor coverings, or household dust, insufficient data are re- ported to define the proximate exposure. As demonstrated here, the likelihood of misclassification of malathion exposure using ur- ine levels of the malathion acids without knowledge of their con- centration in the diet could occur; however, the possibility of misclassification of exposure using DAPs alone would be a virtual certainty.

In Vitro Metabolism of Acetochlor Sulfoxide [14C]Acetochlor sulfoxide (0.025 mM, 15.5 KBq) was incubated at 37\u00b0C with liver, olfactory, and respiratory microsomal fractions (rat, mouse liver 1.0 mg protein; rat, mouse olfactory and rat respiratory, 0.5 mg pro- tein, respectively) in 0.1 M sodium phosphate buffer at pH 7.4 in the presence of 2 mM NADPH in a total volume of 1.0 ml. For the human nasal samples micro- somal fractions (n 5 10; typically 0.4 mg protein) were used when sufficient tissue was available; otherwise S9 fractions (n 5 23; typically 0.5 mg protein) were used. The experiments using liver fractions were terminated at intervals up to 60 min, while those using olfactory and respiratory fractions were terminated at intervals up to 30 min (up to 2 h for the human samples) by the removal of an aliquot of the incubation mixture into an equal volume of ice-cold methanol. The samples were stored on ice for 30 min before centrifugation at 14000 rpm for 3 min to remove precipitated protein. The supernatant was removed for analysis by HPLC. The experiments using rat nasal tissue microsomes were repeated in the presence of coumarin (0\u20130.5 mM) which was added to the microsomal fraction immedi- ately prior to the addition of acetochlor sulfoxide. Cou- marin 7-hydroxylase activity (0.025 mM coumarin; Ju- vonen et al., 1988) was also measured in the presence of acetochlor sulfoxide (0\u20130.025 mM). The metabolism of acetochlor sulfoxide (0.3 mM) by purified human CYP2A6 (0.57 mg protein) was determined over a pe- riod of 30 min. Samples were analyzed using a Shimadzu LC10 HPLC system with a Canberra Packard series A500 Flo-One radiochemical detector and a 15 cm 3 4.6 mm HiRPB-150 column preceeded by a 10 3 4.6 mm HiRPB guard column (Hichrom, UK). The mobile phase consisted of 95% water: 5% acetonitrile. A linear gradient was used over 20 min to 72% water/28% ace- tonitrile, then holding at these conditions for 5 min before linearly increasing to 10% water/90% acetoni- trile over the next 3 min. The flow rate of the mobile phase was 1.0 ml/min. The column eluent was mixed with Canberra Packard Ultima Flo-M scintillant and passed through a 0.5-ml flow cell. In Vivo Studies: Plasma Metabolites Rats (n 5 4) and mice (n 5 10) were given single ral doses of 200 mg/kg C-14 acetochlor (rats: 40 Mbq/ g, 4 ml/kg PEG600; mice: 400 MBq/kg, 8 ml/kg EG600) and killed 17 h later with an overdose of alothane. A further group of rats were given a single ral dose of 10 mg/kg C-14 acetochlor methyl sulfide 30 MBq/kg) and killed 6 h later. Blood was collected by ardiac puncture, centrifuged at 3000 rpm and 4\u00b0C for \u00b0C. Plasma metabolite profiles were also determined in ats (n 5 8) after administration of a diet containing 750 ppm acetochlor for 6 months. Twenty-four hours efore the end of the experiment each rat was given a ingle oral dose of 200 mg/kg C-14 acetochlor (9.25 Bq/kg, 4 ml/kg PEG600) and urine was collected over ry ice for 24 h.

BMD analysis was also used to perform a meta-analysis across dif- ferent assays within the Marty et al. (2012) study and, in one case, across different studies. From the meta-analysis, the recommended BMD10s for brain AChEI are 1.7 mg/kg/day (BMDL10 = 1.3 mg/kg/ day) for acute doses to adults and children, and 0.67 mg/kg/day (BMDL10 = 0.53 mg/kg/day) for repeated doses to children and adults. These values represent the most likely values from analyz- ing the totality of the data and are the most reliable values for cho- linesterase-based risk assessment. Additionally, there were no sensitivity differences for AChEI between males and females, corn oil versus milk vehicles, and pups versus adults. The last compari- son suggests that an additional 10-fold FQPA safety factor is not necessary for CPF to protect children because reliable data support its elimination. Finally, literature data show that brain AChEI is the appropriate metric for cholinesterase inhibition risk assessment for chlorpyrifos.

These two deaths occurred in the highest exposed group and among those with the longest latency (0.5 expected). In a follow-up study the SMR for prostate cancer in the exposed group was 83 based on four deaths (Swaen et al., 1998). In a follow-up study, the SMR for prostate cancer in the exposed group was 92 based on eight deaths (Swaen et al., 2004). 5.4.1. Prostate cancer overview Overall, the results for prostate cancer do not support a causal relationship with AN. The interest in AN and prostate cancer orig- inated with an unexpected finding in the early O\u2019Berg study which found an excess based on very few cases. The subsequent DuPont studies based on large cohorts and larger numbers of prostate can- cers found no significant excess and no dose\u2013response relation- ships. The NCI and Dutch also did not find a significant excess of prostate cancer. As shown in Table 6, among the four major cohort studies there were 61 observed deaths from prostate cancer and 65.9 expected giving a combined SMR of 93 (72\u2013120). Based on these results, it is unlikely that there is a causal relationship be- tween AN and prostate cancer. 6. The case-control studies There are two population-based case-control studies that exam- ined lung cancer and brain cancer. There are two major advantages of AN population-based case-control studies compared to cohort studies of highly exposed AN workers. First is the ability to evalu- ate a relatively large number of uncommon cancers such as brain cancer as was done by Thomas et al. (1987). Second is the ability to address potential confounding factors such as cigarette smoking while examining lung cancer risk as in the study of Scelo et al. (2004). However, major weakness of the population-based case- Table 6 Observed and expected numbers of prostate cancer deaths and SMRs for exposed subjects in four major follow-up studies Study Obs.

Thus, misclassification of exposure was more likely in case-control studies. Scelo et al. report 39 case of lung cancer with acrylonitrile exposure versus 20 controls (RR = 2.2, (1.1\u20134.4)). 22% of the AN exposed jobs in their case-control study occurred in the manufacture of footwear supposedly from nitrile rubbers (Scelo et al., 2004). The exposures referred to in this study presumably would be to nitrile rubbers made up of butadiene and AN which have been used in specialty footwear for construction and farming. There would be low potential for exposure because the AN in this application was polymerized and made up only a small portion of the nitrile rubber. While the study of Thomas et al. found no asso- ciation of AN with CNS cancer (RR = 0.9, (0.5\u20131.6)), the study of Scelo et al. did find such an association with exposure and lung cancer, but the RR was small. Given the low potential for high AN exposure, we will not consider the population-based case-con- trol studies further. 7. Comments Acrylonitrile is a relatively potent carcinogen in rats and mice producing cancers at multiple sites at exposure levels that might occur in the workplace. In some of the early epidemiology studies, such as the first DuPont AN study, a high rate of lung cancer among a small group of highly exposed workers suggested that AN might also be a human carcinogen (O\u2019Berg, 1980). This finding led to the undertaking of four large epidemiology studies of many plants in three countries. These studies included many workers with high exposure to AN. Three of these studies used extensive AN monitor- ing over time to examine exposure\u2013response. In the present review the four most informative cohort stud- ies are evaluated and it is apparent that the results do not sup- port a causal relationship between AN and all cancers or any specific type of cancer. The same conclusion was reached by Col- lins and Acquavella in (1998) in their meta-analyses of 22 stud- ies of AN workers (Collins and Acquavella, 1998). They reported non-significant meta-RRs of 0.9 for lung cancer, 1.2 for brain cancer, 1.0 for prostate cancer, and a significant meta-RR of 1.8 for bladder cancer. However, this RR of 1.8 was considered unli- kely to be related to AN since there was no dose\u2013response rela- tionship and the excess was limited to plants where aromatic amines, known to cause bladder cancer, had been present. Cog- gon and Cole published a review that focused on the more infor- mative studies (NCI, Dutch, and DuPont) and concluded that the weight of evidence indicated that AN was not a human carcino- gen (Coggon and Cole, 1998). They endorsed further studies of more highly exposed workers in an effort to resolve the possibil- ity of a small risk at high exposure levels. In 1999, IARC reached a similar conclusion (IARC, 1999). In fact, IARC actually down- graded acrylonitrile from \u2018\u2018probably carcinogenic\u201d to \u2018\u2018possibly carcinogenic to humans\u201d finding that \u2018\u2018the earlier indications of an increased risk among workers exposed to acrylonitrile were not confirmed by the recent, more informative studies\u201d. This was one of few downgrades of classification by IARC. Our review of the epidemiology data is consistent with the conclusions of the earlier IARC review which found no consistent findings of in- creased cancer risk across studies. 8.

Administration of honokiol microemulsion by cauda vein injection for 30 days caused no obvi- ous toxicities of organs in rats except for the irritation to the vas- cular of the injection site, and based on the serum biochemistry and hematology results, the NOAEL of honokiol microemulsion was considered to be 500 lg/kg under the present experimental conditions in rats. Considering that the effective dose range on global ischemia in mice was 7\u201370 lg/kg body weight, it can be concluded that honokiol microemulsion is very safe used as an effective cerebral ischemia protective agent.

Meanwhile, it has been reported that the optimal orally administered dosage of ATI-7505 in humans is 3\u201320 mg/kg (Camilleri et al., 2007), three times a day. Although further studies are needed to establish the dosage regimen, it seems that the predicted therapeutic dosage regimen of QX100626 in humans is 2\u201310 mg/kg, twice a day for 2 weeks, which is provided by the manufacturer. We can make a prediction on the starting dose to adult health volunteers in the first clinical trial based on the toxicological animal studies, which recom- mended 0.36 mg/kg/day. In conclusion, it is anticipated that QX100626 could be a safe and feasible alternative to other existing prokinetic agents for the treatment of functional bowel disorders, such as functional constipation and constipation-dominant irritable bowel syndrome, if it could be tested safe and effective in clinical trials in the future.

Dietary le- vel of 275 mg MEQ/kg caused the mortality, decrease in the body weights and food intake, an increase in liver enzymes and oxida- tive stress parameters, salt and water imbalance and histological changes, especially in liver and adrenal glands for both genders of rats. Further investigations including genotoxicity, phototoxic and photoallergic reactions and reproductive toxicities must be conducted before reaching to a definitive conclusion about an oral toxicity risk of MEQ.

{"http://tableXtr.pdf/extractedFrom": "file:///Users/theobouganim/Desktop/Inria_work/RTP_PDF/Acute-inhalation-toxicity-of-ammonia--Revisiting-the-imp_2013_Regulatory-Tox.pdf", "PDF_pmid_URI": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23707397", "content": {"CoiStatement": "Either human or animal studies can form the basis for hazard identification and dose-response assessment. However, when both are available the choice of which type of data to use must be based on the inherent strengths and weaknesses of each study and data regardless of whether the data indicate an adverse effect or not. The weakness of past animal inhalation studies with ammonia is the use of whole-body inhalation exposure chambers (not recom- mended any longer by OECD (2009a,b). Likewise, ammonia gas is highly water soluble, i.e., humidified surfaces of whole body inha- lation chambers may act as sink for this gas which means, depend- ing on the sampling location, actual breathing zone concentrations are biased to be underestimated. The time to attain chamber stea- dy state and the collection efficiencies of the analytical sampling trains used have commonly not been reported in detail in past studies. These potential shortcomings were addressed in this study by meticulously devised and validated analytical procedures. No doubt, human evidence is superior to animal data. However, variability in exposure conditions and the limited quantitative information available on exposure intensity and time, especially in context with high-level, accidental exposures, make it difficult to utilize human data for quantitative risk assessment (Lavelle et al., 2012). Not all data reported in context with human exposure may truly reflect breathing zone concentrations of the involved subject(s). In non-blinded human studies the outcome is not inde- pendent on subjective cognitive cues, such as odor and/or chemo- sensation (Cometto-Mu\u00f1iz and Cain, 1984; Doty and Cometto- Mu\u00f1iz, 2003). Onset of perception of ammonia is expected to occur in humans at around 140 ppm (Verberk, 1977) to significant inten- sity of sensory irritation at 500 ppm (Silverman et al., 1949). Inter- estingly, this range is remarkably close to the empirically verified concentration of \ufffd500 mg/m3 (\ufffd700 ppm) (RD30) on rats (Fig. 13). Collectively, in rats moderate-to-significant sensory irri- tation-related effects were observed at 500 mg/m3 (700 ppm) \ufffd 45-min and minimal effects in dogs exposed at 770 mg/m3 \ufffd 8 h (1078 ppm). Exposure limiting appears to be the laryngeal irritation observed in humans at 1700 ppm. This con- centration is 2-fold lower than that just gaining increasing access to the alveolar region of the rat. Overall, an ERPG-2 equivalent of 500 ppm is considered to moderate and reversible stimulation of sensory nerves; however, yet affording the targeted level of protec- tion for more severe types of lung injury to occur. At this exposure level previous studies on humans demonstrated minimal effects of adversity with rapid reversibility (Silverman et al., 1949). Animal data are based on validated and standardized protocols and exposure is to well characterized atmospheres. The concor- dance between defined endpoints and protocols can provide valu- able clues on the consistency of findings as well as the associated most critical mode of action across different species. These options involve a detailed consideration of the comparative dosimetry in humans and experimental animals, including a highly rationalized definition of an all-embracing point of departure (POD). Following this framework, experimental data on animals are utilized as pri- mary source for quantitative risk assessment bearing in mind its limitations. Therefore, a cautious plausibility check is made with published human data to assess the validity and plausibility of the course taken. In summary, the outcome of this and previous studies support an ERPG-2 of 500 and an ERPG-3 of 1500 ppm, respectively. The latter concentration is one third of that causing significant laryn- geal injury. Hence, the proposed estimate implicitly adjusts for po- tential irreversible outcomes. Suffice it to say, for a lachrymatory gas such as ammonia, the distinction between \u2018perceived irritation\u2019 and \u2018debilitating airway and eye irritation\u2019 severe enough to impair escape in unconditioned populations remains to be a difficult en- deavor to judge with definite precision. Conflict of interest statement This study was designed and executed during the course of nor- mal employment by Bayer Pharma. There is no conflict of interests.

However, when both are available the choice of which type of data to use must be based on the inherent strengths and weaknesses of each study and data regardless of whether the data indicate an adverse effect or not. The weakness of past animal inhalation studies with ammonia is the use of whole-body inhalation exposure chambers (not recom- mended any longer by OECD (2009a,b). Likewise, ammonia gas is highly water soluble, i.e., humidified surfaces of whole body inha- lation chambers may act as sink for this gas which means, depend- ing on the sampling location, actual breathing zone concentrations are biased to be underestimated. The time to attain chamber stea- dy state and the collection efficiencies of the analytical sampling trains used have commonly not been reported in detail in past studies. These potential shortcomings were addressed in this study by meticulously devised and validated analytical procedures. No doubt, human evidence is superior to animal data. However, variability in exposure conditions and the limited quantitative information available on exposure intensity and time, especially in context with high-level, accidental exposures, make it difficult to utilize human data for quantitative risk assessment (Lavelle et al., 2012). Not all data reported in context with human exposure may truly reflect breathing zone concentrations of the involved subject(s). In non-blinded human studies the outcome is not inde- pendent on subjective cognitive cues, such as odor and/or chemo- sensation (Cometto-Mu\u00f1iz and Cain, 1984; Doty and Cometto- Mu\u00f1iz, 2003). Onset of perception of ammonia is expected to occur in humans at around 140 ppm (Verberk, 1977) to significant inten- sity of sensory irritation at 500 ppm (Silverman et al., 1949). Inter- estingly, this range is remarkably close to the empirically verified concentration of \ufffd500 mg/m3 (\ufffd700 ppm) (RD30) on rats (Fig. 13). Collectively, in rats moderate-to-significant sensory irri- tation-related effects were observed at 500 mg/m3 (700 ppm) \ufffd 45-min and minimal effects in dogs exposed at 770 mg/m3 \ufffd 8 h (1078 ppm). Exposure limiting appears to be the laryngeal irritation observed in humans at 1700 ppm. This con- centration is 2-fold lower than that just gaining increasing access to the alveolar region of the rat. Overall, an ERPG-2 equivalent of 500 ppm is considered to moderate and reversible stimulation of sensory nerves; however, yet affording the targeted level of protec- tion for more severe types of lung injury to occur. At this exposure level previous studies on humans demonstrated minimal effects of adversity with rapid reversibility (Silverman et al., 1949). Animal data are based on validated and standardized protocols and exposure is to well characterized atmospheres. The concor- dance between defined endpoints and protocols can provide valu- able clues on the consistency of findings as well as the associated most critical mode of action across different species. These options involve a detailed consideration of the comparative dosimetry in humans and experimental animals, including a highly rationalized definition of an all-embracing point of departure (POD). Following this framework, experimental data on animals are utilized as pri- mary source for quantitative risk assessment bearing in mind its limitations. Therefore, a cautious plausibility check is made with published human data to assess the validity and plausibility of the course taken. In summary, the outcome of this and previous studies support an ERPG-2 of 500 and an ERPG-3 of 1500 ppm, respectively. The latter concentration is one third of that causing significant laryn- geal injury. Hence, the proposed estimate implicitly adjusts for po- tential irreversible outcomes. Suffice it to say, for a lachrymatory gas such as ammonia, the distinction between \u2018perceived irritation\u2019 and \u2018debilitating airway and eye irritation\u2019 severe enough to impair escape in unconditioned populations remains to be a difficult en- deavor to judge with definite precision. Conflict of interest statement This study was designed and executed during the course of nor- mal employment by Bayer Pharma. There is no conflict of interests.

Even though the isolation of Bti in organs was positive only until the 14 day of the intravenous study, the high CFU count appears to be a reason to perform a more prolonged study using this route. However, this should be carefully considered, since in the EPA Tier I tests, it is expected that certain microbial agents may be isolated from the test animal, even at the end of the recommended obser- vation periods. Since our intravenous data shows a decline curve of positive isolation during the study, and we don\u2019t have any evi- dence that the microbial agent replicates in the test animal, such isolations should not trigger Tier II testing.

Robustness is preeminent. As more fully explained by Meek et al. (2007) peer review panels have to be scientifically robust, have appropriate panel expertise, be transparent, and be independent. However, a few notes of caution. Everyone is biased. An epidemi- ology study will be reviewed by an epidemiologist differently than by a toxicologist. They each have a bias, for example, towards if there was or was not good measurements of exposure. Biases on a panel should be balanced. In contrast, conflicts of interest, usually financial, on peer review panels need to be avoided. Distinguishing between biases and conflicts is sometimes difficult, but it needs to be done. Another rule of thumb for peer review panels, at least panels for chemical-specific risk assessment topics, is that you need to have about one third of the panel composed of risk assessors of some type, one third chemical or related chemical experts, and one third critical effect experts. Panels often go awry when this balance is not maintained. Balancing affiliations is also important."}},

Supporting professional develop- ment through recruitment, training, and retention of scientists within the FDA and internationally, is a key requirement to meet- ing the demands of regulatory science. NCTR offers research train- ing opportunities through a postdoctoral fellowship program, participating in the FDA Commissioner\u2019s Fellowship Program, and a summer-student training program. NCTR\u2019s Science Training and Exchange Professional Development Program provides an avenue for scientists from across FDA to spend time in the laboratories at NCTR to learn new laboratory skills and to collaborate intellec- tually on advanced regulatory-science techniques. In 2009, with funding from FDA\u2019s OIP, NCTR expanded its training program to in- clude the International Scientist Exchange Program (ISEP). ISEP is designed to enhance global regulatory science by providing train- ing on the core competencies, skills, and techniques to foreign scientists to build the scientific regulatory infrastructure in their home country. Through ISEP, NCTR is uniquely positioned to define future partnerships to bring the global toxicological-research com- munity together, and advance and validate new knowledge to im- prove public health in strategic ways. The panel for Session 4 discussed the best time to initiate edu- cation on regulatory science.

It was also recognised that there is sig- nificant opportunities for the harmonisation of testing require- ments that would contribute to the 3Rs goals in terms of replacement, refinement and reduction in the design and conduct of carcinogenicity studies. However, it was also recognised that consideration of alternative methodologies should be data-driven, and must involve industry and regulatory scientists from the specific sectors involved. Finally, it was also recognised that requirements for carcinogenicity testing are not limited to these sectors and the views of other sectors, not present at the workshop, should be taken into account in future discussions.

No asbestos fibers were detected in the personal air samples from the mechanic. The highest measured air- borne chrysotile concentration, found during this testing was 0.0013 f/ml 8-h TWA. The use of standard workplace practices pro- duces limited fiber release during the handling and removal of asbestos containing aircraft friction materials. These findings indi- cate that light aircraft mechanics are not at risk from asbestos exposure during the routine servicing and replacement of asbestos containing brake systems.

If broadly adopted, it would ease the establishment of a standardized set of accepted allergens for use in regulatory bioinformatics guidelines for food safety.

The parameters such as mentioned under a, b and c or combinations thereof can be used to find correlations between properties of proteins and their allergenic potential. For this strat- egy it is important to define how allergens can be ranked based on their allergenic potential. To this end, one should decide which criteria should be used to scale a panel of low/intermediate/high allergenic proteins. Currently an ILSI Europe Expert Group and TNO are developing an allergenicity scaling system Prioritising of aller- genic foods according to their public health importance (Houben et al., 2016). Furthermore a COST Action network (ImpARAS, www.imparas.eu) has recently started to discuss with an out-of- the-box view, new ideas and more predictive in vivo, in vitro and in silicomodels and approaches to improve the current allergenicity risk assessment strategy, with the focus on sensitisation. A third initiative is the shared research program (SRP) Food allergy, which is initiated by TNO and is a collaboration between industry, uni- versities and TNO. In this program the focus is on the development of a predictive allergenicity assessment strategy which is based on an allergenic scaling as described above and predictive physical chemical and biological markers. This new strategy must help regulatory bodies to assess novel protein (sources) and improve allergy management.

The question remains on whether these prod- ucts could be potentially classified into different risk groups to allow optimization of FIH doses for each class separately. Attributes for risk-associated classification may include but not be limited to the effector function, the number of binding sites for each antigen within each product, and the relative affinity towards each antigen. CD3 bispecific constructs are a rather new generation of immune activating products with only one product approved in the US. Additional clinical experience with these products is needed to have a better understanding of pharmacologic and structural at- tributes contributing to toxicities.

Our review finds that for calcu- lation of human starting dose, 1/6th the HNSTD in cynomolgus monkeys or 1/10th the STD10 in rodents using the BSA approach for animal-to-human conversion generally resulted in an accept- able balance of safety and efficiency in dose escalation. Other acceptable approaches are 1/10th HNSTD in cynomolgus monkeys using the BSA scaling and 1/10th NOAEL in rodents or monkeys using the BW scaling. FIH dose selection algorithms that were con- sidered unsafe consist of: 1/6th HNSTD, 1/10th HNSTD, and 1/10th STD using BW for animal-to-human dose conversions. While the animal data for the vc-MMAE platform yielded a variable range of HNSTDs in cynomolgus monkeys, the human MTD were report- ed with a tighter range and there was a steep dose-dependent threshold for toxicities in patients. Overall, for all the INDs includ- ed in our analysis, there was a good correlation between HNSTD and human MTD. For ADCs sharing the small molecule drug, the same linker, and the same SM:Ab ratio, available prior clinical data can inform the design of a safe yet efficient Phase 1 clinical trial design. As the database available for nonclinical and clinical stud- ies using novel ADCs grows, additional analysis will be useful to inform ADC drug development program design and implementation.

There is currently a need for optimization of FIH dose selection or optimization of FIH trial design to minimize the number of pa- tients exposed to sub-therapeutic doses. Until a safe and yet effi- cient approach for FIH dose selection is established for these products, it may be best to optimize the FIH trial designs to allow rapid attainment of active therapeutic doses. For antibodies, re- ceptor binding is directly associated with activity. For CD3 bispe- cifics, however, additional factors are involved such as binding to both targets, proximity of targets, and relative affinity towards the two targetsdall of which can affect pharmacologic activity. Therefore, many factors should be considered for FIH dose selection for CD3 bispecific constructs and further data collection and appropriate modeling are warranted. Collaboration and data sharing among industry representatives may be needed for assessing and establishing more efficient approaches for FIH dose selection for immune activating products.

It is the duty of national market sur- veillance officials or external border controllers to verify cosmetics\u2019 compliance with safety rules. In some cases, the producer or distributor recalls non-compliant merchandise and reports it to the appropriate market surveillance office. The possible variation in compliance with these regulations may have influenced the number of reported dangerous skin lightening products. In our previous research on the European market (Michalek et al., 2019), we did not analyze reports on adverse events. In the case of interpretation of data from CAERS, caution must be applied. In such databases, one can expect underreporting bias. Especially regarding skin lightening, that is a common practice among socially vulnerable pop- ulations (Peltzer et al., 2016), with a long history of colorism and classism, underreporting of adverse events, e.g., due to limited access to healthcare services, cannot be ruled out."}},

Without it, incentives for investment are undermined, new product development is curtailed, and existing prod- ucts are removed from markets. A number of key provi- sions of REACH fail to provide certainty for businesses, not only for their investment and growth, but also for their knowledge of compliance requirements. In addition to the issues related to the provisions of substances in articles dis- cussed in the previous paragraph, the issue of failure to pro- vide certainty applies also to some of the criteria triggering authorisation for chemical substances and the actual authorisation review process. For example, the proposed Article 54(f) stipulates the requirement to include substances which are identiWed as causing serious and irreversible eVects to humans or the environment which are equivalent to those of other sub- stances listed in paragraphs (a)\u2013(e) of Article 54 (i.e., sub- stances considered to be Category 1 or 2 carcinogens, mutagens, or reproductive toxicants according to Directive 67/548/EEC; persistent, bioaccumulative and toxic; or very persistent and very bioaccumulative) on a case by case basis into the list of substances subject to authorisation of the regulation (i.e., Annex XIII).

Finally, the photochemical reactivity concordance with the in vitro phototoxic result profile obtained within the 3T3 NRU as- say supports the utility of this test to detect phototoxic hazard as no \u2018false\u2019 phototoxic responses were observed. However, extrapo- lation of these data to in vivo phototoxic risk warrants further investigation because of the high percentage of compounds elicit- ing a positive response in the 3T3 NRU assay that are negative in animal studies or in the clinic (Ferguson, 2002; Lynch and Wilcox, 2010). This may be due to factors such as lack of significant photo- activating light penetrating through tissue, or a lack of systemic distribution of drug into light exposed tissues.

The overall weight of evi- dence represented by the available genotoxicity data (in vitro and in vivo), and carcinogenicity data for DMP and its structural analogues, supports the conclusion that this class of phenanthrene-based opioids, and DMP, in particular, are not genotoxic in vitro or in vivo, and do not represent a carcinogenic risk to patients.

Twice-daily dosing in ani- mals was less well tolerated than a QD dose regimen, with the in- crease in toxicity correlating with increased trough plasma sitaxentan concentrations; again, mean threshold trough concen- trations for sitaxentan-related effects in animals were substan- tially greater than in humans. This pattern of results across animal toxicology studies can be characterized as exaggerated pharmacology and suggest a favorable benefit:risk profile for sitax- entan when used as directed in humans. Subsequent clinical expe- rience revealed an unacceptable risk for idiosyncratic liver toxicity leading to the voluntary withdrawal of Thelin\ufffd from the market (Galie et al., 2011). The absence of significant liver toxicity in pre- clinical species highlights a shortcoming of preclinical species to accurately predict human outcomes, not a deficiency in the pack- age of studies conducted, which was regarded as appropriate according to international guidelines (European Medicines Agency, 2010). The preclinical species studied here do not appear to pro- vide a model of human liver toxicity sufficient for mechanistic investigation. Whilst the potential to implicate inhibition of BSEP transport by sitaxentan as an important factor in the pathogenesis of clinical liver injury is alluring, further mechanistic investigations are required to connect interactions at the molecular level with idi- osyncratic toxicity observed in a small number of patients taking Thelin\ufffd. A balanced examination of other known risk factors in the etiology of liver injury observed clinically, including specific patient risk factors (e.g. genetics), is necessary.

However, the analyses presented here reveal that this particular substitution is likely to affect the EDSP program opposite of what was intended, for the following reason. Justifiably, EPA and others agree that in principle, in vivo assays should be given more weight than in vitro assays in the interpretation of the Tier 1 screening results (Borgert et al., 2011a; US EPA, 2011a). Hence, replacing an in vivo with in vitro assays would shift interpretational emphasis to the other in vivo endpoints remaining in the battery. Because the Tier 1 in vivo screens vary widely in meeting performance cri- teria, as shown here, this particular substitution would shift inter- pretational emphasis from the most reliable in vivo assay in the battery (Uterotrophic) to the least reliable (Pubertal Assays). Unless EPA is given the time and resources to fully evaluate perfor- mance of the battery, it will be difficult to make improvements to the battery without incurring unforeseen liabilities.

They were different from major deficiencies, Q5, Q9, Q10 and Q12, found in the RTF process of the present study. It is possible due to the following reasons. First, the assessments focused on different stages of review process. Second, the differences in applicants\u2019 defi- ciency profile suggested a possible chronological change from 2012 to 2017. Third, the regulatory requirement moves forward over time be- cause GMP compliance has been recently required for all manufacturing sites including APIs and drug products (Q5) (Taiwan MHW, 2015a, 2015b). For bioequivalence dossier, key deficiencies leading to RTF were associated with validation reports and spectra of bioanalytical methods (Q3 of Table 6) and bioanalytical reports and raw data (Q4 of Table 6). Previously a U.S. FDA survey of 2484 bioequivalence submissions de- monstrated that analytical issues were the common deficiencies at first- cycle review of the generic drug applications during years 2001\u20132008 (Liu et al., 2012) which is corresponding to the RTF items Q3 and Q4 in the current study. Further investigation revealed that inadequate long- term storage stability and missing raw data were the most commonly occurring deficiencies for bioanalytical method validations and bioa- nalytical reports, respectively (Williamson et al., 2014). On the con- trary, lack of analytical spectrum became the major issue for Q3 and Q4 to impede a substantial review in Taiwan (data not shown).

These results indicated that the NGR motif of rhIFNa2a-NGR could induce the generation of spe- cific antibody in few animals. This is because NGR has too weak immunogenicity to stimulate the generation of specific antibodies. With regard to long-term toxicity of rhIFN-a2a-NGR in Shuhong Dong rats and rhesus monkeys, our previous gross necropsy and histopathol- ogical examination did not reveal any remarkable changes in important tissues including heart, liver, lung, kidney, brain, spleen, thymus, lymph node, pancreas, hypothyroid, adrenal gland and bone marrow. Furthermore, the clinical chemistry, hematology and urine parameters remained unaffected (Meng et al., 2008). Taken together, these data indicate that BAB and NAB to rhIFNa developed in serum in Shuhong Dong rat and rhesus monkey after administra- tion of rhIFNa2a-NGR but that these antibodies did not cause obvious pathological consequence. In conclusion, our study dem- onstrates that rhIFNa2a-NGR has obvious anti-tumor efficacy in vivo, perhaps due to the tumor-homing peptide NGR. Thus rhIFNa2a-NGR represents a promising novel drug for effective treatment of cancer. Acknowledgments This study was supported by a grant from NSFC (No. 30572210) in China.

Fur- ther, while a sufficient performance assessment of the SCT sensi- tivity was not possible for agrochemical formulations alone or the complete data set, specificity and overall concordance of both SCT and SIT were comparable the values for the complete data set (SCT: 91% vs. 89% specificity, 91% vs. 89% accuracy and SIT: 64\u201388% vs. 70\u201385% specificity, 56\u201375% vs. 53\u201376% accuracy). Therefore, while generally some improvements of the RhE-based assays for the different classification systems may be feasible, we have shown that RhE-based methods seem to be applicable to as- sess the irritant potential of agrochemical formulations. In several regions, the in vitro SIT is not accepted for regulatory use for agro- chemicals and agrochemical formulations. We encourage other industry laboratories to share data with the wider scientific com- munity in order to facilitate replacement of the rabbit test for this large sector of substances.

However, wrong diagnoses can arise from diagnoses made before adequate tests, which may remain as pseudo-diagnoses. Drug compliance can be a problem in a drug-surveillance study. There is no information about whether the patients took the drugs at the proper dosage throughout the whole period of the supposed administration. DI surveillance research using the HIRA database is much more complex than surveillance of AE case reports. Unlike AE case reports, the data are analyzed using standard procedures. In the process, con- siderations arise at numerous points, ranging from mathematical is- sues to how healthcare professionals input their patient diagnoses.

Validation indicated that the LLNA, when correlated to the guinea pig sensitisation tests, approached not more than a 90% level of accuracy and tests in either species performed less well than this in terms of prediction for humans (Dean et al., 2001). This means that they will be incorrect on a proportion of occasions and more so with individual classes of chemistry for which they are, for whatever reason, demonstrated to be poor predictors. Given the prominence of the LLNA in REACarl Haux, this does represent a situation in which those responsible for making both the type of regulatory hazard assessments discussed here, as well as assessments for occupational and/or consumer safety, should ensure that they are fully cognizant of all factors and use the weight of evidence ap- proach when limited information is available (Basketter et al., 2007a,b,c; Gerberick et al., 2005; Basketter and Kimber, 2006; Api et al., 2008).

The outcome of this assessment paradigm is a risk characterization that facilitates the subsequent manage- ment of risks in various environments (e.g., water, air). Thus, in practice, the mitigation of environmental risks is dependent upon the availability and transparent communication of data that in- forms the core components of the risk assessment paradigm. The surrogate methodology presented here illustrates an approach that enables hazard identification and dose\u2013response assessment for potential environmental chemical risks when the lack or virtual absence of data may have previously inhibited assessment. Expo- sure assessment and risk characterization are needed to complete a full risk assessment. Conflict of interest statement The authors declare that there are no conflicts of interest.

This assumes a standard duration for a Phase 1 clinical trial where exposure does not exceed 30 days; this methodology is not recommended for Phase 1 clinical trials in which individual patient dosing exceeds this duration. While there are assumptions inherent to default values, recommendations in Table 7 are considered protective for short-term exposure even if there is limited toxicological/pharmacological data. Nonetheless, if there is data to support a higher or lower ADE, then it should be used to derive such a limit.

Because the highest monitor is what determines compliance, based on US EPA\u2019s models, other monitors will be farther below the standard. It appears to be underappreciated that, with the current standard of 0.075 ppm, areas in attainment can only have monitors with values over 0.075 ppm three times in a year, and that, because compliance is determined by the monitor measuring the highest concentrations, most other monitors will have measured concentra- tions that do not approach this level. For example, the 18 monitors meeting the current ozone standard in the Houston\u2013Galveston\u2013 Brazoria area in 2014 measured fourth highest, three-year average ozone concentrations of 0.066\u20130.075 ppm, whereas the design value for the entire 8-county area was 0.08 ppm. In addition, nine monitors in Texas exactly met the current ozone standard from 2012 to 2014 (TCEQ, 2013). The maximum 8-h average ozone con- centration during the high ozone season (April to October) at these monitors was 0.0443 \u00b1 0.0035 ppm, well below the standard.

With its slower review and approval times for both priority-status and standard products, together with the signiWcant varia- tion in the clinical importance of medications, the most appropriate strategy would appear to be to discontinue the priority-status system and devote suYcient resources to reviewing most medications within a timely, general performance standard. Health Canada appears to concur with this strategy because it aims to meet its performance targets for the review of 90% of all new submissions for pharmaceuticals by 2005\u20132006 and for biologics by 2006\u20132007 (Health Canada, 2004), although it is not clear how this will be achieved.

Following OECD guidelines most compositional studies offer the advantages of rigorous quantitative assays. These quantitative data supply much of the crop composition data now recorded in the ILSI database allowing this resource to promote a further understand- ing of the variability that occurs naturally in crops, which serve as a source of nutrients for humans and animals. Data from studies conducted in the US, Argentina and Brazil over multiple growing seasons described in this report have further illustrated the effect of geography, growing season, and genetic background on soybean composition. Fatty acids and isoflavones were shown to be partic- ularly variable in these studies. A separate investigation of 96 dif- ferent maize hybrids grown at three locations in the US demonstrated that levels of free amino acids, sugars/polyols, and molecules associated with stress response, such as glycerol and glycine betaine, can vary to a greater degree than that observed for more abundant components. Together, this report provides fur- ther understanding of the variability that occurs naturally in crops which serve as a source of nutrients for healthy diets in humans and animals.

In contrast, only about 40\u201360 DBPs have been ana- lyzed in total by all manufacturers to date. Therefore, it is crucial that the analytical methods established for drinking water and pool water analysis should be vigorously applied in the ballast water setting. To facilitate this we have outlined a scheme for iden- tification of by-products, a standardized procedure for effects assessment and classification and a check-list for identifying occu- pational exposure situations. Last but not least we recommend that the discharge of mutagenic and carcinogenic substances into the ocean should be minimized with regard to the precautionary principle.

If the TTC threshold is close to the estimated systemic bioavailability, specific considerations and expert judgement are necessary.

Conclusions Conflict of interest disclosures Funding/support Role of sponsor Acknowledgements Transparency document References", "Disclosure": "For dermal exposure to low level impurities, the decision tree can generate a prediction of bioavailability which could be used with TTC. Our approach will need to be applied on a case by case basis with expert judgement and in depth knowledge. Case studies demonstrated that the model in most cases over predicts dermal availability, but under some circumstances also under predicts. If the TTC threshold is close to the estimated systemic bioavailability, specific considerations and expert judgement are necessary.

The results of this study have highlighted that 50% of personal samples studied contained average fiber concentrations that exceeded the REL proposed by the NIOSH (0.1 f/ml). Despite findings of exposures in excess of OSHA and NIOSH recommenda- tions, it is unknown if these exposures have any potential health consequences for exposed workers. Periodic monitoring, full engi- neering controls and respiratory protection are recommended to be in compliance with OSHA and NIOSH recommendations.

In situations, such as the current study, where airborne Wbers concentra- tions remain extremely low or below the analytical level of detection, compliance with the recommendation is diYcult. Several methods have been suggested to oVset the eVects of low Wber densities including decreasing the surface area of the Wlter or increasing the sampling Xowrates (Cherrie et al., 1986). During the current study, the range of applied Xow- rates varied from 2 to 10 lpm. The Wber concentrations determined through PCM and TEM analysis for air sam- ples collected at the diVerent Xowrates did not noticeably diVer, and indicate the absence of airborne Wbers, both asbestos and non-asbestos, within the automotive repair facility. The potential error associated with low Wber densi- ties has been demonstrated to result in high Wber counts and frequently yield overestimated airborne Wber concen- trations (Cherrie et al., 1986). 222 C.L.

The statistical evaluations performed with the data indi- cate that concentration additivity is the best model approach for the type of interaction (receptor mediated antagonistic effects). Furthermore, the dose additivity of the antiandrogenicity of flu- tamide and vinclozolin is underlined by the molecular mechanism of receptor occupancy as common mechanisms of actions which believed to result in dose additivity (Borgert et al., 2004; Boobis et al., 2008). Consequently, for this type of interaction concentra- tion additivity would appear to be the most reasonable regulatory approach for situations in which combined exposure needs to be assessed.

Data reduction and multivariate statis- tical analyses were used in order to remove subjectivity from these comparisons. Notwithstanding the limitations discussed previ- ously, the observation that the gene changes elicited by Cr(VI) are more similar to nonmutagenic than mutagenic carcinogens is consistent with evidence that Cr(VI) induced redox changes in the intestine at both carcinogenic and noncarcinogenic concentra- tions, as well as lack of evidence for micronucleus formation and k-ras mutation after 90 days of exposure to Cr(VI) concentrations in drinking water as high as 182 mg/L. Thus, while there is substan- tial data (mainly from in vitro studies) that indicate Cr(VI) can interact directly with DNA, target tissue data do not support a mutagenic MOA for Cr(VI) in the small intestine. As part of a weight of evidence evaluation of the MOA for Cr(VI)-induced intes- tinal carcinogenesis, the analyses in this report add further support to the hypothesis that the intestinal tumors in the mouse duode- num are the result of a nonmutagenic MOA.

One of the specific issues OSHA considered infeasible was the effectiveness of medical surveillance in the con- struction industry. An excerpt from the General Industry standard will illustrate this point: Because initial medical surveillance and periodic follow-up is pre- dicated upon air monitoring results, the shortcomings of air monitoring for the construction industry, as discussed above, undermines the ef- fectiveness of the medical surveillance program. The temporary worker may thus not get a medical exam or blood test result until after the lab results of air sampling return, and follow ups long after he leaves the job (OSHA, 1978).", "Acknowledgement": "Acknowledgements This work was partially supported by the Center for Environmental and Occupational Risk Analysis and Management at the University of South Florida.

There have been a number of recent inci- dents where imported products from China to the US markets such as toys, jewelry, bibs, and lunch boxes were found to have dan- gerously high lead contents. In 2007, the US Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) signed an agreement with the Chinese authorities to introduce safety checks on products such as toys, cig- arettes, electrics and fire-works before imported to the US (CPSC, 2007). Of course regulation might be enforced by the requirement of the importing countries. As for cosmetics, there were a series of recalls when chromium and neodymium were found in nine SK-II products (http://www.bpfk.gov.my/pdfworddownload/ skII.pdf) as well as ten Chinese cosmetics had dexamethasone, chloramphenicol and metronidazole (http://www.chinaretail- news.com/2007/11/27/931-ministry-of-health-recalls-ten-chi- nese-cosmetics/). Since then there were few announcements to tighten the safety of cosmetics in order to be in compliance with international regulatory standards (http://www.export.gov/china/ exporting_to_china/cosmetics.asp, 2007). There should be always certificate export with each cosmetic to assure that it complies with regulations in the destination country. Significant differences in regulations exist among different countries. There have been two incidents where imported products from China such as toothpaste and toys because of diethylene glycol and lead content, respec- tively, were removed from the Saudi markets (http://www.reu- ters.com/article/newsOne/idUSL2372574020070823, 2007; http:// www.iht.com/articles/ap/2007/08/25/africa/ME-GEN-Saudi-China- Toy-Recall.php, 2007).

Statistical analysis There are two primary differences between a toxicology study and a fertility study (Table 8). In an NHP toxicology study, all fe- males are dosed on the same calendar day, whereas in a fertility study, all females are dosed on the same day of their menstrual cy- cle (Chellman et al., 2009). Thus, the first dosing phase cycle after initiation of AMG ZX.41 treatment was not included in the inter- pretation or statistical analysis because each animal was treated for a different number of days during this cycle. Secondly, the smaller group size of a standard repeat-dose toxicity study means that if a biologically meaningful prolongation is considered at least 1.5-fold the control value, there is 80% statistical power (signifi- cance level p 6 0.05) at a coefficient of variation (CV) of 20\u201325% to make the conclusions there is no meaningful prolongation at n = 6. Assessment of recovery is challenging in the repeat-dose tox- icity study because most animals are euthanized for histopathol- ogy at the end of the dosing period and recovery animals may only be included in the control and high dose groups. In addition, recovery may not be assessed in the same animals that demon- strated an effect (prolonged or absent cycle) during the dosing phase. 5. Conclusion In conclusion, it is feasible to monitor menstrual cycling in chronic toxicology studies as long as certain conditions are met: \ufffd Target liability or evidence from previous studies suggest a cause for concern, \ufffd females must be sexually mature and should have evidence of cycling prior to shipment to the testing facility, \ufffd 3 months pre-study are considered optimal for animals to return to normal cycling following the stress of shipment, han- dling and cagemate assignment at the testing facility (this dura- tion can be reduced if animals are socialized at the holding facility), \ufffd animals should be randomized, including assigning recovery animals as cagemates, upon arrival at the facility and should not be moved or co-mingled with other animals prior to dosing, \ufffd the method for calculating menstrual cycle length should be agreed upon prior to study start, \ufffd the first pre-dose cycle and the first dosing phase cycle should be excluded from analysis, \ufffd a mixed effect analysis of covariance statistical model can be used to evaluate the cycle length data.

Zablotny et al. / Regulatory Toxicology and Pharmacology 62 (2012) 474\u2013481 of treatment on sperm count per gram of tissue, or on sperm motil- ity, sperm morphology, or fertility. These effects are inconsistent with neonatal hypothyroidism induced by propylthiouracil, which causes increased, rather than decreased, testicular weight when administered to rats shortly after birth (Cooke et al., 1992; St-Pierre et al., 2003). It is possible that postnatal developmental exposure to iodine causes these effects, but there are no published data to address this question. In the rat DT study, the only fetal morphological alteration was an increased incidence of umbilical hernia, which was observed in four fetuses from three litters at 1000 mg/kg/day vs. no cases in controls. There was significant maternal toxicity at this dose level, as indicated by body weight loss early in the treatment period and a 43% decrease in body weight gain across the entire treatment period. Umbilical hernia was also noted at 40 mg/kg/day in the two-generation study, where the incidence was three F1 pups from two litters and seven F2 pups from five litters, vs. none in controls or the lower dose level groups (data not shown). In all of these cases, the fetuses/pups presented with a small bulge at the navel, but the overlying skin remained intact. Due to the minor nature C.L. Zablotny et al. / Regulatory Toxicology and Pharmacology 62 (2012) 474\u2013481 481 and reversibility of this finding, it is considered a variation and not a malformation (Warkany, 1971). While this finding of umbilical hernia is consistent between these two studies conducted many decades apart, there is discor- dance of this finding with reproductive toxicity studies contempo- raneous to the two-generation study. Interestingly, despite achieving higher doses than the two-generation study, umbilical hernia was not observed in the Saghir et al. (2012b) one-generation study at the dose of 80 mg/kg/day, or in a prior one-generation study in which 0, 20, 80 or 200 mg/kg/day were given to groups of 30 male and female CD rats (unpublished data). This apparent lack of consistency among the four studies (one rat DT and three rat reproductive studies), in addition to unknown possible biolog- ical mechanism to explain these apparent effects, makes the toxi- cological significance of this finding difficult to ascertain. In summary, DIMPTS produced evidence of reproductive and neonatal toxicity in the rat, but only at parentally toxic dose levels. In contrast, there were no developmental effects in the rabbit, de- spite maternal toxicity at the high-dose level. Overall, the NOELS for maternal and developmental toxicity for the rat and rabbit developmental toxicity studies were 100 and 300 mg/kg/day and 0.5 and 2 mg/kg/day, respectively. In the rat two-generation repro- ductive toxicity study, the NOEL for parental toxicity could not be determined, while the NOEL for reproductive toxicity was 2.5 mg/ kg/day. Many of the effects observed are consistent with the liter- ature of iodine toxicity, which led to further research to evaluate this mode of action as described in the companion paper by Saghir et al. (2012b). Conflict of interest statement The authors work for the company at which the substance is produced.

Seven of the 14 pre-defined gastrointestinal adverse events (gas with discharge; diarrhea; oily spotting; oily evacua- tion; oily stool; liquid stool; soft stool) were reported more fre- quently by subjects receiving 25 or 40 g/day of EPG, especially females. In general, the incidence and duration of these symptoms correlated with EPG dietary concentration and suggest that 10 g/day of EPG was reasonably well tolerated.

Gee et al. / Regulatory Toxicology and Pharmacology 93 (2018) 84e9190 with the following trends being observed T189 > THS > THP1.0(T) for Group 1, M322 > THP1.0(M) for Group 2 and THS > THP1.0(T) for Group 3. The total daily MLE to NFDPM when using THP1.0(T) and THP1.0(M) was less than half that with cigarettes. Group 1 and 2 smokers reported consuming an average of one to two non-study cigarettes during THP1.0(T) and THP1.0(M) placement periods, indicating that compliance with the study protocol was high for the majority of participants. Although MLE for cigarettes is often estimated using part-filter analysis (St. Charles et al., 2009), early investigations into the application of this methodology for use with THP1.0(T) proved unsuccessful, most likely due to the differences in the kinetics of formation and transfer of constituents of the THP1.0(T) aerosol to the mouthpiece. Poget et al. (2017) extended the filter assay approach to estimating MLE for use with mouthpieces of the THS consumable. Relationships between the nicotine retained in the mouthpiece and harmful and potentially harmful constituents in the aerosol generated by machine smoking were investigated. Many of the relationships were determined to be polynomial rather than linear, as has been observed for cigarettes. This approach to regression modelling of the relationships between constituents retained in the mouthpiece of THPs and the mainstream aerosol merits further investigation. The use of optical obscuration to produce estimates of MLE for smokers has been reported previ- ously by Slayford and Frost (2014). In this study, the method was extended to produce estimates of MLE to NFDPM, nicotine and menthol for THPs. The suitability of this approach for use with THPs was examined by comparison of the agreement between the optical NFDPM and NFDPM produced from duplicated human records. The mean differences between the measurements of optical NFDPM and NFDPM of \ufffd1.9 to 0.4 mg/stick for the THP products are reasonable considering that the accepted variability in the mea- surement of the NFDPM is \u00b11 mg or 15%, whichever is the greater (ISO 8243:2013) (ISO, 2013) when measured according to ISO 4387:2000 (ISO, 2000). The difference between the two method- ologies was greater for the cigarettes (between 2.7 mg and 3.4 mg) than for the THPs. This difference is greater than that of \u00b11.3 mg per cigarette over the range of 1e23mg yields reported by Slayford and Frost (2014). This difference is likely due to the increase in the repeatability limit in the measurement of the NFDPM with higher yields, which is reported as 1.19 mg/cig at a mean yield of 17.40 mg NFDPM per cig (ISO 4387:2000). Cigarettes in this study had a higher ISO NFDPM yield than those used in the Slayford and Frost study, with resultant yields of up to 37.8 mg NFDPM observed in duplication smoking. Further investigations to improve the agree- ment between the twomethodologies at higher NFDPM are needed to understand the sources of variation. The novel approach of using real-time optical obscuration offers a cost-effective approach to estimating consumers\u2019 MLE to NFDPM, nicotine and menthol from aerosols generated by combustible cigarettes and THPs.

Failure to do this may have potentially trivial consequences\u2014a mild rash, a transient ocular irrita- tion or no effect whatsoever. However, for potentially toxic materials or for drugs with potent pharmacological activ- ity, failure to read the product literature or a subsequent decision to ignore the advice, may have grave consequences including severe local effects (eye damage) or systemic effects, and in some cases disability or death. A regulator may conclude that if a product cannot be used safely or if evidence suggests that for a marketed product the advice is being routinely ignored, then the product should not be authorized or its MA should be suspended or withdrawn. To facilitate user compliance, labels for veterinary medici- nal products should be as uncluttered as possible and infor- mation regarding safe use, contraindications and precautions should be clear, unambiguous and concise. If faced with vast amounts of text and advisory phrases, human nature will ensure that frequently, this will be ignored. The phrases \u2018\u2018keep out of reach of children\u2019\u2019 and \u2018\u2018shake well before use\u2019\u2019 may ensure a degree of peace and encourage physical fitness but may do nothing for safe and effective use of a medicinal product. 8.

Instead of considering each new chemical as an unknown entity, the toxicity of the chemical under investigation can be directly inferred deriving all informa- tion available from similar compounds whose activities are known. For this purpose we developed automated and reproducible read- across models for the quantitative prediction of carcinogenic potency providing an automatic process for analogues selection and prediction, as well as enabling interpretation of the results obtained thought visual inspection of the similar compounds. Indeed our models don\u2019t involve any subjective choices in terms of analogue selection, that is very often very time consuming, but the similar compounds are chosen automatically, considering not only the similarity based on chemical structure but also the fea- tures relevant for the toxic endpoint studied. The models have been validated and they provide predictions with errors within the same order of magnitude than the estimated variability of experimental data. Moreover through the user friendly platform, soon freely available online, the analysis and visualization of the similar compounds selected, together with the prediction confi- dence, will enable the toxicologists to review the results obtained.

Modeling residential levels of naphthalene in indoor air Approximate long-term average indoor air levels can be used to estimate the strength of sources in indoor air. The relationship between the mass of a compound released to indoor air and average levels can be approximated by mod- eling the house as a single compartment.

About one third of the managers and OHS staff also claimed to use the list of OELs in their line of work. We have no means to ascertain the nature and scope of that use based on the present study. However, on the basis of the results presented herein it could be questioned whether the OELs are used in a sound manner. There still seems to be a generally po- sitive attitude towards OELs, as also seen in Schenk and Wester (in press). Hence, targeted information and inspection efforts from SWEA might be efficient in countering this lack of awareness and understanding regarding the Swedish OELs. As worker protection is reasonably in the interest of both the employees themselves and the employers, this should also be an important issue for the social partners, i.e. business organisations and trade unions. The SWEA has already stated that they are positive towards collabora- tion with the social partners regarding communication on OEL re- lated issues (SWEA, 2011b). Previous research in risk communication has shown that information does not necessarily lead to knowledge, nor does information or knowledge necessarily lead to action (Hale, 1984; Finnegan and Viswanath, 1997). Improving awareness and understanding can be assumed to in- crease the ability of Swedish workplaces to use and comply with Swedish OELs, but it will not necessarily mean that OEL use and compliance also will increase. Inspection activities may prove more efficient than information, as they previously have been shown to have effect on compliance with OHS regulations in Swe- den (Bj\u00f6rkdahl et al., 2008). Aiming solely at proper use of and compliance with OELs as pri- mary tools of risk management is probably not the most efficient path towards chemicals risk reduction at Swedish workplaces. Rather, OELs may serve as an evaluation tool of safe work practices. Compliance with an OEL serves as evidence of (sufficiently) effec- tive health and safety management, because, as has been pointed out by Walters et al.

In addition to considering all the studies, they performed meta-analyses of all tumors suggested as increased by styrene exposure. There was no increase in lymphohematopoietic can- cers (leukemias, lymphomas), pancreatic, esophageal, lung or kidney cancers when all studies were included. When only studies of reinforced plastics workers were considered, there was slight increase in kidney cancer (meta-relative risk= 1.13 (95% CI=1.01\u20131.27) and for lung cancer (risk= 1.26 (95% CI= 1.16\u20131.36). One study found an inverse dose-response of lung cancer to styrene exposure (Collins et al., 2013). A nested case-control study (Wong, 1990) concluded that smoking was the cause of increased lung cancer in this cohort. 13. Lack of site concordance In some cases, increase in cancer occurs in different organs in dif- ferent species. Therefore, it is possible that styrene could cause a dif- ferent cancer in humans than the lung tumors seen in mice. Data in rats do not support a hypothesis that styrene causes cancer in different tissues in different species since no tissues had increased cancer in- cidence from even very high styrene exposures, up to 2000mg/kg/day by gavage or 1000 ppm by inhalation (Cruzan et al., 1998). A primary concern in human studies has been increased total lym- phohematopoietic (LH) cancers or in specific types of LH cancer. No increase in LH cancers, Non-Hodgkin lymphoma or leukemia was found in the US cohort studies (Collins et al., 2013; Ruder et al., 2004) or in G. Cruzan et al. Regulatory Toxicology and Pharmacology 95 (2018) 17\u201328 26 the UK cohort (Coggon et al., 2015). An increase in leukemia was found among Danish potential RPC workers with less than one year of ex- posure, but not more than one year, or among those hired before 1960 (Kolstad et al., 1994). In the update of this study, there was no increase in leukemia or lymphoma (Christensen et al., 2017). In the multi- country EU cohort (of which Coggon and Kolstad were a part), there was an increased risk of malignant lymphoma based on average ex- posure, but not cumulative exposure (Kogevinas et al., 1994). Inter- pretations of this dataset are highly variable. Some have interpreted this dataset to provide limited evidence of carcinogenicity from styrene in humans (NTP, 2011; NAS, 2014), while others concluded there was no evidence of carcinogenicity from these studies (Boffetta et al., 2009). In a systematic review of the epidemiologic studies (Collins and Delzell, 2018) performed meta-analysis of several tumor types. They performed meta-analysis of risk from data in 13 studies of workers in reinforced plastics, synthetic rubber and monomer/polymer produc- tion. Meta-relative risks for all studies were 1.14 (95% confidence in- terval (CI), 0.91\u20131.43) for NHL, 0.98 (95% CI, 0.87\u20131.09) for all leu- kemia, 0.97 (95% CI, 0.82\u20131.15) for lymphoid leukemia, 1.06 (95% CI, 0.80\u20131.39) for myeloid leukemia, 1.03 (95% CI, 0.92\u20131.15) for eso- phageal cancer, 1.02 (95% CI, 0.93\u20131.12) for pancreatic cancer, 1.09 (95% CI, 0.95\u20131.24) for lung cancer and 1.10 (95% CI, 0.99\u20131.22) for kidney cancer; the risk for cancer from styrene exposure was not sta- tistically increased for of these cancer types. 14. Conclusion Strong evidence has been developed that styrene (and similar compounds) are metabolized to ring-oxidized compounds in mouse lung club cells (Table 10). When produced in sufficient quantity, these metabolites cause tissue responses in mouse lungs with enhanced gene expression. These data sets support a molecular initiating event for styrene of direct mitogenicity from mouse-specific CYP2F2-mediated metabolites that appear to activate Nr4a signaling. Longer-term mod- ifying factors include down-regulation of Nr4a genes and shifts in both circadian clock transcription factors (TFs) and other TFs, linking cir- cadian clock to cellular metabolism. No gene expression changes in- dicative of cytotoxicity or activation of p53-mediated DNA-damage pathways was found at any time of exposure. In the absence of CYP2F2 metabolism, or CYP2F1 metabolism in TG mice, neither styrene nor SO produce cytotoxic or proliferative changes in lung (styrene includes 104 week exposure to 120 ppm styrene). The lack of SO toxicity in both the KO and TG mouse strains supports a conclusion that SO is not the proximate metabolite accounting for the lung toxicity and tumor- igenicity of styrene in mice. Importantly, the mode of action evidence also supports a conclusion that SO formed in humans primarily by CYP2E1 is not subsequently metabolized by CYP2F1 to ring-oxidized metabolite(s) in amounts sufficient to present a lung toxicity or tu- morigenicity risk. The role of CYP2F2 metabolism as an essential mode of action gateway event responsible for mouse lung toxicity is consistent with toxicity and mode of action data in rats. Rats have less CYP2F (2F4) than mice and therefore produce less ring-oxidized metabolites. No cytotoxic, proliferative or tumorigenic changes are found in the lungs of rats exposed to styrene, even up to 1000 ppm for 2 years. Overall, the animal MoA data unequivocally indicate that lung tu- mors are unique to the mouse due to mouse-specific metabolism of styrene by CYP2F2 (Fig. 1). Thus, the MoA indicates styrene-induced mouse lung tumors are likely qualitatively, or possibly quantitatively, not relevant to humans.

In addition to considering all the studies, they performed meta-analyses of all tumors suggested as increased by styrene exposure. There was no increase in lymphohematopoietic can- cers (leukemias, lymphomas), pancreatic, esophageal, lung or kidney cancers when all studies were included. When only studies of reinforced plastics workers were considered, there was slight increase in kidney cancer (meta-relative risk= 1.13 (95% CI=1.01\u20131.27) and for lung cancer (risk= 1.26 (95% CI= 1.16\u20131.36). One study found an inverse dose-response of lung cancer to styrene exposure (Collins et al., 2013). A nested case-control study (Wong, 1990) concluded that smoking was the cause of increased lung cancer in this cohort. 13. Lack of site concordance In some cases, increase in cancer occurs in different organs in dif- ferent species. Therefore, it is possible that styrene could cause a dif- ferent cancer in humans than the lung tumors seen in mice. Data in rats do not support a hypothesis that styrene causes cancer in different tissues in different species since no tissues had increased cancer in- cidence from even very high styrene exposures, up to 2000mg/kg/day by gavage or 1000 ppm by inhalation (Cruzan et al., 1998). A primary concern in human studies has been increased total lym- phohematopoietic (LH) cancers or in specific types of LH cancer. No increase in LH cancers, Non-Hodgkin lymphoma or leukemia was found in the US cohort studies (Collins et al., 2013; Ruder et al., 2004) or in G. Cruzan et al. Regulatory Toxicology and Pharmacology 95 (2018) 17\u201328 26 the UK cohort (Coggon et al., 2015). An increase in leukemia was found among Danish potential RPC workers with less than one year of ex- posure, but not more than one year, or among those hired before 1960 (Kolstad et al., 1994). In the update of this study, there was no increase in leukemia or lymphoma (Christensen et al., 2017). In the multi- country EU cohort (of which Coggon and Kolstad were a part), there was an increased risk of malignant lymphoma based on average ex- posure, but not cumulative exposure (Kogevinas et al., 1994). Inter- pretations of this dataset are highly variable. Some have interpreted this dataset to provide limited evidence of carcinogenicity from styrene in humans (NTP, 2011; NAS, 2014), while others concluded there was no evidence of carcinogenicity from these studies (Boffetta et al., 2009). In a systematic review of the epidemiologic studies (Collins and Delzell, 2018) performed meta-analysis of several tumor types. They performed meta-analysis of risk from data in 13 studies of workers in reinforced plastics, synthetic rubber and monomer/polymer produc- tion. Meta-relative risks for all studies were 1.14 (95% confidence in- terval (CI), 0.91\u20131.43) for NHL, 0.98 (95% CI, 0.87\u20131.09) for all leu- kemia, 0.97 (95% CI, 0.82\u20131.15) for lymphoid leukemia, 1.06 (95% CI, 0.80\u20131.39) for myeloid leukemia, 1.03 (95% CI, 0.92\u20131.15) for eso- phageal cancer, 1.02 (95% CI, 0.93\u20131.12) for pancreatic cancer, 1.09 (95% CI, 0.95\u20131.24) for lung cancer and 1.10 (95% CI, 0.99\u20131.22) for kidney cancer; the risk for cancer from styrene exposure was not sta- tistically increased for of these cancer types. 14. Conclusion Strong evidence has been developed that styrene (and similar compounds) are metabolized to ring-oxidized compounds in mouse lung club cells (Table 10). When produced in sufficient quantity, these metabolites cause tissue responses in mouse lungs with enhanced gene expression. These data sets support a molecular initiating event for styrene of direct mitogenicity from mouse-specific CYP2F2-mediated metabolites that appear to activate Nr4a signaling. Longer-term mod- ifying factors include down-regulation of Nr4a genes and shifts in both circadian clock transcription factors (TFs) and other TFs, linking cir- cadian clock to cellular metabolism. No gene expression changes in- dicative of cytotoxicity or activation of p53-mediated DNA-damage pathways was found at any time of exposure. In the absence of CYP2F2 metabolism, or CYP2F1 metabolism in TG mice, neither styrene nor SO produce cytotoxic or proliferative changes in lung (styrene includes 104 week exposure to 120 ppm styrene). The lack of SO toxicity in both the KO and TG mouse strains supports a conclusion that SO is not the proximate metabolite accounting for the lung toxicity and tumor- igenicity of styrene in mice. Importantly, the mode of action evidence also supports a conclusion that SO formed in humans primarily by CYP2E1 is not subsequently metabolized by CYP2F1 to ring-oxidized metabolite(s) in amounts sufficient to present a lung toxicity or tu- morigenicity risk. The role of CYP2F2 metabolism as an essential mode of action gateway event responsible for mouse lung toxicity is consistent with toxicity and mode of action data in rats. Rats have less CYP2F (2F4) than mice and therefore produce less ring-oxidized metabolites. No cytotoxic, proliferative or tumorigenic changes are found in the lungs of rats exposed to styrene, even up to 1000 ppm for 2 years. Overall, the animal MoA data unequivocally indicate that lung tu- mors are unique to the mouse due to mouse-specific metabolism of styrene by CYP2F2 (Fig. 1). Thus, the MoA indicates styrene-induced mouse lung tumors are likely qualitatively, or possibly quantitatively, not relevant to humans.

In addition to considering all the studies, they performed meta-analyses of all tumors suggested as increased by styrene exposure. There was no increase in lymphohematopoietic can- cers (leukemias, lymphomas), pancreatic, esophageal, lung or kidney cancers when all studies were included. When only studies of reinforced plastics workers were considered, there was slight increase in kidney cancer (meta-relative risk= 1.13 (95% CI=1.01\u20131.27) and for lung cancer (risk= 1.26 (95% CI= 1.16\u20131.36). One study found an inverse dose-response of lung cancer to styrene exposure (Collins et al., 2013). A nested case-control study (Wong, 1990) concluded that smoking was the cause of increased lung cancer in this cohort. 13. Lack of site concordance In some cases, increase in cancer occurs in different organs in dif- ferent species. Therefore, it is possible that styrene could cause a dif- ferent cancer in humans than the lung tumors seen in mice. Data in rats do not support a hypothesis that styrene causes cancer in different tissues in different species since no tissues had increased cancer in- cidence from even very high styrene exposures, up to 2000mg/kg/day by gavage or 1000 ppm by inhalation (Cruzan et al., 1998). A primary concern in human studies has been increased total lym- phohematopoietic (LH) cancers or in specific types of LH cancer. No increase in LH cancers, Non-Hodgkin lymphoma or leukemia was found in the US cohort studies (Collins et al., 2013; Ruder et al., 2004) or in G. Cruzan et al. Regulatory Toxicology and Pharmacology 95 (2018) 17\u201328 26 the UK cohort (Coggon et al., 2015). An increase in leukemia was found among Danish potential RPC workers with less than one year of ex- posure, but not more than one year, or among those hired before 1960 (Kolstad et al., 1994). In the update of this study, there was no increase in leukemia or lymphoma (Christensen et al., 2017). In the multi- country EU cohort (of which Coggon and Kolstad were a part), there was an increased risk of malignant lymphoma based on average ex- posure, but not cumulative exposure (Kogevinas et al., 1994). Inter- pretations of this dataset are highly variable. Some have interpreted this dataset to provide limited evidence of carcinogenicity from styrene in humans (NTP, 2011; NAS, 2014), while others concluded there was no evidence of carcinogenicity from these studies (Boffetta et al., 2009). In a systematic review of the epidemiologic studies (Collins and Delzell, 2018) performed meta-analysis of several tumor types. They performed meta-analysis of risk from data in 13 studies of workers in reinforced plastics, synthetic rubber and monomer/polymer produc- tion. Meta-relative risks for all studies were 1.14 (95% confidence in- terval (CI), 0.91\u20131.43) for NHL, 0.98 (95% CI, 0.87\u20131.09) for all leu- kemia, 0.97 (95% CI, 0.82\u20131.15) for lymphoid leukemia, 1.06 (95% CI, 0.80\u20131.39) for myeloid leukemia, 1.03 (95% CI, 0.92\u20131.15) for eso- phageal cancer, 1.02 (95% CI, 0.93\u20131.12) for pancreatic cancer, 1.09 (95% CI, 0.95\u20131.24) for lung cancer and 1.10 (95% CI, 0.99\u20131.22) for kidney cancer; the risk for cancer from styrene exposure was not sta- tistically increased for of these cancer types. 14. Conclusion Strong evidence has been developed that styrene (and similar compounds) are metabolized to ring-oxidized compounds in mouse lung club cells (Table 10). When produced in sufficient quantity, these metabolites cause tissue responses in mouse lungs with enhanced gene expression. These data sets support a molecular initiating event for styrene of direct mitogenicity from mouse-specific CYP2F2-mediated metabolites that appear to activate Nr4a signaling. Longer-term mod- ifying factors include down-regulation of Nr4a genes and shifts in both circadian clock transcription factors (TFs) and other TFs, linking cir- cadian clock to cellular metabolism. No gene expression changes in- dicative of cytotoxicity or activation of p53-mediated DNA-damage pathways was found at any time of exposure. In the absence of CYP2F2 metabolism, or CYP2F1 metabolism in TG mice, neither styrene nor SO produce cytotoxic or proliferative changes in lung (styrene includes 104 week exposure to 120 ppm styrene). The lack of SO toxicity in both the KO and TG mouse strains supports a conclusion that SO is not the proximate metabolite accounting for the lung toxicity and tumor- igenicity of styrene in mice. Importantly, the mode of action evidence also supports a conclusion that SO formed in humans primarily by CYP2E1 is not subsequently metabolized by CYP2F1 to ring-oxidized metabolite(s) in amounts sufficient to present a lung toxicity or tu- morigenicity risk. The role of CYP2F2 metabolism as an essential mode of action gateway event responsible for mouse lung toxicity is consistent with toxicity and mode of action data in rats. Rats have less CYP2F (2F4) than mice and therefore produce less ring-oxidized metabolites. No cytotoxic, proliferative or tumorigenic changes are found in the lungs of rats exposed to styrene, even up to 1000 ppm for 2 years. Overall, the animal MoA data unequivocally indicate that lung tu- mors are unique to the mouse due to mouse-specific metabolism of styrene by CYP2F2 (Fig. 1). Thus, the MoA indicates styrene-induced mouse lung tumors are likely qualitatively, or possibly quantitatively, not relevant to humans.

A rapid and simple HPLC meth- od was developed and validated, which showed acceptable sensitiv- ity, accuracy, and precision with respect to the purposes of this study. The study was well-conducted with no notable unexpected issues, using 14 healthy male volunteers. The overall data obtained in the volunteers showed that the two products are bioequivalent in terms of both the rate and extent of the bioavailability of both the active ingredients taken separately. To address the concern of \u2018combined bioequivalence\u2019, i.e., the bioequivalence of each active in presence of the other one, we proposed a new index, range over- lap index (ROI), which reflects the extent by which the CI90% ranges of two actives for each parameter overlap each other. The test prod- uct was regarded as bioequivalent with respect to this index as well. Conflict of interest There was no conflict of interest for any of the authors of this paper.

Two key components to understand the strategy of applying bioinformatics are its inclusion in a WoE assessment of allergy safety and the interpretation of the bioinformatics alignment data itself. In particular, when there is no relevant database of sequence information, as has been the case in attempting short contiguous epitope matching comparisons, there are limitations in their utility. Importantly, bioinformatics is not a stand-alone determinant of allergenic potential. Therefore, when interpreting alignment data it should be recognized that exceeding the international guidance for bioinformatics similarity is not proof of allergenic potential as these guidelines are very conservative. Rather, bioinformatics can best be described as a screening tool to determine whether more rigorous in vitro serology testing, or other technologies, may help to determine the capacity of a novel protein to cause allergy.

This started with genetic markers, particularly in oncology, but is rapidly extending to include non-invasive images and geno- mic, proteome and metabolomic profiles also for other therapeu- tic areas. The strong added value of this approach is that clinical testing towards proof of concept can be done in smaller, more homogeneous patient populations with higher change of success and reduced development time and costs. Although this is unli- kely to apply to all human diseases, the first outlook towards \u2018personalized medicines\u2019 is there and shows great promise to- wards the future.

Thus, these values are not \u2018\u2018bright lines\u201d that distinguish safe from unsafe exposure levels. Chronic exposure guidance values are set at exposure levels that are expected to be protective over a lifetime of exposure. For short-lived compounds such as BPA, an exceedance of the corre- sponding BE value in a single urine sample may or may not reflect continuing elevated exposure. As demonstrated in the limited available datasets and based on the kinetics of urinary elimination, spot urinary concentrations may vary substantially both within and across days in an individual. Thus, occasional exceedances of the BE value in individuals in cross-sectional studies do not imply that adverse health effects are likely to occur, but can serve as an indicator of relative priority for further risk assessment follow- up. Further discussion of interpretation and communication as- pects of the BE values is presented in LaKind et al. (2008) and at www.biomonitoringequivalents.net.

Based on this extensive database, we present here BE values that can be used in the evaluation of population biomonitoring data for urinary fluoride concentrations in the context of existing risk assessments (which are population based risk management tools). Based on this evaluation, urinary fluoride concentrations between 1.1 and 2.1 mg/L (1.2\u20132.5 mg/g creatinine) are consistent with three of the US and Canadian exposure guidance values. Urinary fluoride concentrations of 1.1 mg/L (1.2 mg/g creatinine) are also expected to be consistent with the IOM adequate intake value for ages >6 months. Because of substantial within- and between-individual variation in urinary flow and creatinine excretion rates, as well as the rapid urinary elimination pharmacokinetics of fluoride, concentrations of fluoride in individual spot samples may vary substantially even when underlying exposures rates are consistent and within the exposure guidance values. For this reason, we recommend that the BE values derived here be applied to the eval- uation of central tendency estimates for populations, rather than to the evaluation of individual spot sample concentrations.

Thus, evaluation of biomonitoring data using these BE values may result in different conclusions regarding the need for risk assessment follow-up, depending on which exposure guidance value is judged by the risk manager to provide the most relevant basis for assessment. BE val- ues do not represent diagnostic criteria and cannot be used to eval- uate the likelihood of an adverse health effect in an individual or even among a population. Further discussion of interpretation and communications aspects of BE values is presented in LaKind et al. (2008).

This approach is necessary to reduce unnecessary repetition of clinical tests in instances where mechanism of action is not known to be the same or unknown completely, along with increasing company expenditures by funding additional clinical trials. Both the EU and US have guidance documents in place for bio- similars that will result in approvals for products that are as safe and efficacious as the innovator product. The necessity exists to outline distinguishable naming nomenclature and how the concept of pharmacovigilance, extrapolation and interchangeability will be handled and regulated in the future. These issues may be key to the marketability of a biosimilar. Depending on how the future regu- lations and requirements define and regulate theses terms, these terms will mold the outcome of many companies\u2019 future pipelines and dividends, especially in the US.

(1989) study have been ana- lyzed, initially based on median <150 lg/L, then on mean <150 lg/L and then on maximum <150 lg/L. Simple linear regres- sion (or population-weighted) linear regression of the crude mor- tality rates and of the standardized mortality ratios (with respect to either southwest Taiwan or all Taiwan) yielded negative or non-positive slopes. Poisson regression of the mortality distribu- tions based on village medians showed only negative slopes, some of which, mostly those including female bladder cancers, were sta- tistically significantly negative. Use of the mean or maximum as the exposure metric eliminated confounding from villages with very high (>500 lg/L) well water arsenic levels. Poisson analyses based on the use of the mean or the maximum levels were statis- tically significantly negative for bladder cancer models and for models with bladder and lung cancers combined. Extension of the analytic population to include southwest regional data simi- larly demonstrated statistically significantly negative slopes for ar- senic levels when the models included a variable for non-arsenic area factors. Significant positive slopes could only be obtained when models assumed that all differences between areas could only be attributed to arsenic exposure levels.

Similarly, the collection of biological specimens distant to the respiratory tract may not necessarily mirror the processes taking place at the spe- cific microenvironments/anatomic locations within this organ. As long as no simple mechanistic explanation of human asthma can be provided, it appears to be premature to advocate one simple \u2018acute\u2019 animal bioassay for risk assessment. Moreover, apart from genetic predisposition, exposure factors, the associated metric, and the dose (con- centration \u00b7 exposure time)\u2013response relationship of irrita- tion and allergy need to be characterized. Despite this complexity, repeated challenge protocols using endpoints known to integrate the biological response (BAL, histopa- thology, lung function measurements) appear to be most promising to define dose\u2013effect relationships both for sensi- tization and asthma-like respiratory responses. Conse- quently, it remains elusive to search for a single, universal biomarker that predicts this complex disease. Acknowledgments The author thanks P. Eidmann, and A.

Other topics included encouraging further development of the kinetic DPRA (kDPRA) and evaluation of the dose-response relationships of in vitro methods as a means to characterize potency (e.g. Wareing et al., 2017). It was also seen that there should be opportunities to assess (Q) SAR across a range of chemistries/industry sectors. All of these efforts might be assisted by establishing a series of mutually agreed potency benchmarks - recognising that efforts in this direction have already been undertaken (e.g. Hoffmann et al., 2018). In this respect, it is worthwhile to be reminded of an issue that regularly causes confusion - substances that do not classify are not necessarily entirely without skin sensitising activity. Consequently, it is much more appropriate to refer to this group as \u2018not classified\u2019; they are not exclusively \u2018non-sensitisers\u2019.

Acknowledgments 6 Lessons from tobacco? 7 Stakeholder engagement 8 Summary of the issue Conflict of interest Acknowledgments References", "Compliance with ethical standards": "To date, engagement between cannabis growers and experts in pesticide science and regulation has been limited. Safety and compliance information for this sector is virtually absent. Several institutions have programs in pesticide safety education, entomol- ogy, horticulture, toxicology and other disciplines that promote best management and stewardship practices for agricultural commodities. University-based Extension Services can develop and disseminate educational materials and foster local relation- ships with growers and retail establishments. Many of these research-intensive universities are leaders in integrated pest management (IPM) approaches for pest control as well. IPM recommendations on cultural practices or mechanical controls to control common pests of cannabis, such as spider mites or pow- dery mildew, could prevent initial pest infestation and the need to resort to pesticides in the first place (Cranshaw, 2011). The cannabis industry has not been a required participant in the training and certification required to license and track professional applicators. These programs provide opportunities to interface with specialists and pesticide regulatory authorities in a forum that encourages information exchange and conveys important legal and safety concepts. The educational needs of the cannabis industry, from growers to retail stores visited by growers, are immense. They include basic information on worker protection standards, label comprehension and compliance, storage and disposal issues, IPM techniques, and fundamental tenets of pesticide toxicology. In addition, outreach and engagement with the general public engaged in the home cultivation of cannabis within legalized States is important to help prevent misuse or harm (Johnson and Miller, 2012). 8.

Summary of the issue To address public health and occupational safety concerns asso- ciated with pesticides and cannabis, legalized States are likely to continue to explore various approaches that balance safety with 288 D. Stone / Regulatory Toxicology and Pharmacology 69 (2014) 284\u2013288 legal compliance. Legalized States are adapting complementary approaches that leverage the existing pesticide regulatory infra- structure. During this transitional period, engagement between credible resources and stakeholders is critical. The vetted regula- tory and academic framework that benefits numerous agricultural sectors can be readily extended to the cannabis community. As this industry emerges from the shadows, the opportunities to protect health and promote good stewardship practices should not be lost.

But to ensure the safety and effective therapeutic, the indications, dosage, medication therapy, side effects and other considerations should be strictly application. In this study, most people used it for the treatment of dog bites or psoriasis, and there were 6 cases used it as nourishing medicine. The average dosage was 3.36 g, with the range from 0.2 g to 25 g, all of them were above the stipulation of \u201cChinese Pharmacopoeia\u201d. The deadly scene of 17 cases died reflected that the shortage of acknowledgement about the toxicity of cantharides among the village doctors and people who took the medicine by themselves. We should pay much more attention to popularize the health knowledge of high-toxic Chinese traditional medicines in the crowd, which is helpful to improve the health level of the whole people and standard the medication and to avoid the oc- currence of adverse events. In China, cantharides for treatment of skin disease and dog bites were first recorded in \"Mingyi bielu\" of Han Dynasty and \u201cWeisheng yi- jianfang\u201d of Ming Dynasty respectively. So the history of cantharides usage in Chinese is long, although oral or external application has been adopted from ancient times to the present, there still lack relevant datas on the differences in toxic dosage between oral and external applica- tion. It is important for health care providers to be able to recognise the dosage difference of cantharidin poisoning in different methods and make efforts to explain the correlation between dosage and methods, then it will reduce potential risk of cantharidin poisoning. In addition to cantharides, other toxic Chinese traditional medicines are still widely used as folk remedies, such as trichosanthe is used for abortion, the use of oleander in the treatment of mental illness, toxic mushroom is used in diet therapy et al., which require the health authorities to pay at- tention to the importance of systematic pre-clinical studies and of regulatory guidelines to review the safety of traditional medicines. Then, Chinese traditional medicines will be scientifically and reason- ably applied to clinical practice after fully understanding the pharma- cological mechanism and toxicological effect of it."}},

Thus, the decrease in mammary gland tumors with ruxolitinib could be at least partially attributed to dietary restriction as a result of decreased food consumption in high-dose female rats (Shuey et al., 2016). In addition, as stated earlier, the mechanism for the decrease in mammary gland tumors after administration of baricitinib or rux- olitinib also likely involves inhibition and downstream regulation of the JAK/STAT pathway and ultimately inhibition of prolactin signaling. Tofacitinib was also tested similarly in 6-month and 2-year carcino- genicity studies in mice and rats, respectively (CDER, 2011). There were no drug-related neoplasms in mice but there were interstitial cell tumors in the testis of male rats; benign thymomas in the thymus of female rats; and malignant hibernomas in female rats (a rare tumor not meeting statistical significance, but observed at a higher than usual incidence (EMA, 2013). No such findings were observed with bar- icitinib or ruxolitinib administration. In our study, administration of baricitinib doses up to 69-fold ex- posures greater than exposures at the 4-mg did not result in neoplasm. This may be due to its selectivity for JAK1/JAK2 and differentiates from tofacitinib, which is selective for JAK1/JAK2/JAK3 (Clark et al., 2014; Fridman et al., 2010). This difference in mode of action translates into potential differences in leukocyte and lymphocyte cytokine signaling responses to them, and their potential role in carcinogenesis. The most significant differences between baricitinib and tofacitinib IC50 values were for the cytokines that signal through a JAK1/3 complex. For cy- tokines known to signal through JAK1/JAK3 (IL-2, IL-4, IL-15, and IL- 21), in leukocyte subtypes (B cells, CD4+ T cells, CD8+ T cells, NK cells, and monocytes), baricitinib has been shown to inhibit signaling with significantly less potency than tofacitinib (McInnes et al., 2016). This is consistent with tofacitinib being a more potent JAK1/2/3 in- hibitor in cell-based assays than baricitinib (Clark et al., 2014). For example, the IC50 values for IL-15, IL-4, and IL-21 signaling were higher for baricitinib, depending on the leukocyte subpopulation; whereas, tofacitinib was more potent with IC50 values in these same cell types and with the same donors (McInnes et al., 2016). IL-15 and IL-21 play important roles in natural killer (NK) cell maturation and function (Floros and Tarhini, 2015). These results suggest that the most sig- nificant difference between baricitinib and tofacitinib is in the inhibi- tion of cytokine signaling mediated by the JAK1/3 complex with tofa- citinib expected to have a more pronounced inhibitory effect on those cytokines, including those involved in NK cell function. NK cells pro- vide vital protection against tumor development through their ability to recognize and eliminate transformed cells (Ghiringhelli et al., 2005). These data are consistent with the tumor findings demonstrating that tofacitinib produced lymphomas in a 39-week monkey study, and Leydig cell tumors, hibernomas, and thymomas in a 2-year rat study (EMA, 2013). Genotoxicity study results for baricitinib (unpublished results) show negative genotoxic or mutagenic potential, supporting the current data and similar to published data on ruxolitinib (Ruxolitinib, 2011). In contrast, although tofacitinib tested negative in the Ames assay, it in- creased the number of abnormal cells in the presence of metabolic ac- tivation in the chromosome aberration assay and caused an increase in polyploidy in the absence of metabolic activation (EMA, 2013). It is unclear if these differences among baricitinib, ruxolitinib, and tofaci- tinib are related to their chemical structure or their JAK inhibitory selectivity. 5. Conclusion Baricitinib was not carcinogenic when administered to Sprague- Dawley rats for 2 years or to Tg. rasH2 mice for 6 months. It resulted in a decrease in the incidence of mammary tumors in female rats and is likely related to reduced prolactin signaling via inhibition of down- stream JAK/STAT signaling. A decrease in hepatocellular neoplasia, hepatocellular foci, and fibrosis may also be related to inhibition of JAK/STAT signaling and its impact on other key signaling pathways.

The results show that PAH content found in tank bottom solids, collected from E&P sites located in environmentally sensitive and geographically distinct areas throughout Texas, cannot reliably be used to determine the PAH content in contaminated soil. Also, these results dem- onstrate that the magnitude of TPH concentration may be a useful indicator of potential risk from PAHs in crude oil- contaminated soils and provide credibility to the 1% (10,000 mg/kg) TPH cleanup level with respect to PAH toxicity.

Conclusions Acknowledgments Transparency document References", "Acknowledgement": "While this research is not a comprehensive survey of commer- cially available products, it does demonstrate that many of the HPHCs evaluated in conventional tobacco cigarettes (FDA, 2012b) may not be applicable to measure in e-cigarette formulations and aerosols. However, the constituents that were observed in this study might provide insights regarding potential impurities likely to be further investigated with other products in this emerging product category. This work also demonstrates the urgent need for a standardized puffing regime for e-vapor products in order to make reasonable comparisons among studies. It is also imperative that standardized analytical testing methodologies be established for e-cigarettes in order to reduce analytical variability and maxi- mize sensitivity for reported values of potential impurities in these products. A comprehensive survey of commercially available e- cigarettes would then be of value to the scientific community and regulators; however, this, too, is a challenging endeavor as these unregulated products are often changing, and new product forms frequently emerge in the marketplace.

The physical characteristics of the TCs were very reproducible and similar to 2R4F, but differed from that of Quest\u00ae 3 cigarettes. Unlike PM USA denic RCs, Quest\u00ae 3 cigarettes possess ventilation, 20% more tobacco mass/cigarette, and they contain activated carbon in the filter. As more data becomes available it will be interesting to see how the physical and chemical profiles of SPECTRUM\u00ae RCs compare with those of other genetically modified VLN RCs (Quest\u00ae 3) and nicotine-extracted RCs such as PM USA denic RCs.

One company, Swedish Match, has published standards for the maximum levels of TSNAs, certain heavy metals, and other trace-level contaminates that it would allow in its snus products (Sund\u00e9n, 2001). These stan- dards are known collectively as the GothiaTek\ufffd standard (Swedish Match, 2001) and include standards for the tobaccos and ingredi- ents used as well as the processing conditions for the manufacture of snus. Trace-level contaminants included on the GothiaTek\ufffd list include (limits in parentheses are on a dry-weight basis): Total TSNAs (10 ppm), N-nitrosodimethylamine (10 ppb), benzo[a]pyr- ene (20 ppb), nitrite (7 ppm), arsenic (0.5 ppm), cadmium (1 ppm), chromium (3 ppm), lead (2 ppm), nickel (4.5 ppm), and nitrite (7 ppm) (GothiaTek\ufffd, 2008). The GothiaTek\ufffd standard also states that products must meet the Swedish Match pesticide pol- icy, but the details of that policy are not given. In any case, some but not all, experts on health effects of tobacco have suggested that contemporary Swedish snus (i.e., meeting GothiaTek\ufffd standards) is safe enough to be recommended by health authorities as an alter- native to cigarettes (Levy et al., 2004). The GothiaTek\ufffd standard ap- pears to have been adopted by British\u2013American Tobacco (Williamson and Proctor, 2007; Williamson et al., 2007) and by the European Smokeless Tobacco Council (2007). However, others have suggested that compliance with the GothiaTek\ufffd standard may not be enough. Pappas and colleagues recently (2008) sug- gested that the list of metals used to characterize the toxicity of STP be expanded to include barium, beryllium, and cobalt. SCENI- HR cited work showing the organic and aqueous extracts of STP were mutagenic and/or clastogenetic (SCENIHR, 2008; IARC, 2007; Rickert et al., 2007). The fact that such genotoxicity was found at all raises the question of other toxicants being present in addition to those included in the GothiaTek\ufffd standard. There is also a strong relationship between use of certain STP and oral mucosal lesions, particularly in Scandinavia where most users of STP have a characteristic \u2018\u2018snuff-induced lesion\u201d (Kallischnigg et al., 2008). That also points to toxicants in STP that are not cov- ered by the GothiaTek\ufffd standard (Lauterbach, 2008). Therefore, one objective for the work reported here was to explore the toxico- logical properties of contemporary STP as measured by in vitro bio- assays for cytotoxicity, clastogenicity, and mutagenicity. Another objective was to determine the levels of target analytes in the STP sold in Canada. Another purpose of this research was to begin building a market map of commercially available STP similar to the commercial cigarette market map reported by Counts and her col- leagues (Counts et al., 2006). However, it should be noted that dif- ferences among the different types of STP included in this study, the method of use (e.g. oral versus nasal), and the typical amount of product used per day by a consumer make such mapping exer- cises more challenging than they are for cigarettes. 2.

Therefore, and as ISO international standard 16672 for ocular endotamponades is currently under revision, we suggest that the best procedure to guarantee the safety of PFCLs for ophthalmic use is a combination of appropriate analytical and biological methods which pay attention to the hydrophobic and volatile nature of the products. Any methods used to guarantee safety need to be validated, and all impurities that can cause toxicity should be removed or reduced as low as possible from the medical devices and should remain under risk management until the absence of significant contamination can be de- monstrated and evaluated during the life cycle of the product.

Pharmacol. 73 (3), 897e902.", "Acknowledgement": "The limitations in our understanding of asthma etiology and biological mechanisms, together with a lack of validated predictive assays for assessing asthma induction or elicitation, require the use of alternative hazard-based safety assessment methods to address chemical-induced asthma risks whenmaking decisions proactively. A toolkit has been proposed for safety assessment to provide a health-protective screening method that utilizes weight-of- evidence principles for identifying chemicals that may increase asthma risk (Maier et al., 2015; Vincent et al., 2016). This systematic approach used in conjunction with an active risk management program provides a mechanism to limit potential asthma concerns, identify any concerns that arise, and ensures deployment of an approach to mitigate asthma-related risks.

These acute effects were attenuated after chronic treatment, possi- bly through a mechanism involving desensitization of b2-adrener- gic receptors. Our findings will contribute to our understanding of the complexities of glucose homeostasis maintained by the adren- ergic system, and provide new insights into the mechanisms underlying the clinical side effects of b2 agonists.

Dose-dependent response shown by accu- mulation of glycogen, cholesterol and impaired triglyceride metabolism in the liver, irrespective of dose leads to impair- ment in transport of these precursors, which are used in various synthetic processes in diVerent organs. DEP also causes mitochondrial proliferation at higher concentrations and peroxisome proliferation at lower concentrations. At present, DEP is among the highest used fragrance mediums at various concentrations making it more liable to daily exposure. However, reviews conducted by the Cosmetic Ingredient Review (CIR, 1985), US EPA (Environmental Protection Agency, 1981,), ScientiWc Committee on Cos- metic Products and Non-Food Products (SCCNFP) (SCCNFP, 2002, 2003) and World Health Organization (WHO) (WHO (2003) have declared DEP to be least toxic at currently used levels in various consumer products. But such adverse eVects observed by consumption of DEP at lower as well as higher doses could lead to an enhanced toxic eVect in the future.

Acknowledgments 5 Conclusion Conflict of interest Acknowledgments References", "Compliance with ethical standards": "The use of combination alpha-blocker and anticholinergic therapy is recommended if there are co-existing BOO and OAB symptoms along with BPH (Claus G. Roehrborn, 2008). The combi- nation of an alpha-blocker and anti-muscarinic agent is useful to improve patient compliance and therapy monitoring in these patients. In a study to evaluate the beneficial effects of alpha-adrenergic antagonists alone or in combination with an anticholinergic agent, it was found that the combination improved symptoms in 73% pa- tients with BOO and DO, who had not responded well to alpha- adrenergic antagonist alone (Lee et al., 2006). Another trial studied the combination of tamsulosin and tolterodine versus tamsulosin alone in patients with BOO, DO and LUTS over three months. The authors concluded that combination treatment significantly im- proved the QoL and also storage symptoms without compromising urine outflow (Athanasopoulos et al., 2003). A study by Kaplan et al. (2005) demonstrated the efficacy of tolterodine in BPH/LUTS patients who had failed to respond to alpha-blocker monotherapy. The utilization of anticholinergic agents in BPH/LUTS alongside OAB helps to improve the static component of the condition and subsequently, enhances the QoL of the patient. A fixed dose combination of 10 mg alfuzosin and 5 mg solifen- acin was developed and compared against co-administration of individual reference products by evaluation of pharmacokinetic parameters. The doses were selected based on the starting dose generally recommended for these drugs. Thus, the FDC contained 10 mg Alfuzosin and 5 mg Solifenacin. The formulation was devel- oped for a once-daily regimen. Alfuzosin is recommended to be administered with food, which improves bioavailability. Solifena- cin can be administered with or without food. The US-FDA guide- line on bioavailability/bioequivalence studies recommends that, for prolonged release products such as the Test product used in this study, study is preferably performed under fed conditions. Conse- quently, this study was performed under fed conditions. S. Nazarudheen et al. / Regulatory Toxicology and Pharmacology 67 (2013) 226\u2013231 231 and individual tablets were tolerated well by the subjects. The safety and efficacy of Alfuzosin and Solifinacin is well established. This product will serve to reduce the pill burden on the patient and compliance to treatment. Based on the efficacy of the individual components, the formulation will also result in improvement in QoL. Therefore, this FDC can be used in patient population safely and effectively.

This risk should preclude the use of Chinese herbal injections in treating normally self-healing conditions, such as common colds and URTIs. In addition, the safety of Chinese herbal injections would be improved if they were delivered as targeted treatments for indicated disease processes, if their constituent complexity and variability were reduced, and if controlled clinical trials as well as studies examining their toxicol- ogy and allergenic potential were conducted. We especially under- score careful application of herbal injections in clinics to avoid any misuse. Conflict of interest statement The authors declare that there are no conflicts of interest.

Our opinions are driven by our desire to protect public health using the best science available, irrespective of the funding sources and other potential sources of bias, such as research funding. A critical discussion of how data are interpreted and any related methodological issues should be based on the science alone. To be clear, we disagree with the approach proposed by Bergman et al. (2015) for evaluating and determining endocrine disruption. We support developing stronger data and relying upon a fuller view of the science.

Westerholm, L. Schenk / Regulatory Toxicology and Pharmacology 68 (2014) 51\u201358 included some very old references reporting data derived when e.g. methods for assessing exposure were less refined or incorrectly cit- ing dose descriptors. Variations in the approach to data selection and evaluation are expected, as for industrial chemicals registrants (most often) differ for each substance, while for cosmetic ingredi- ents the same expert group (although with some variations in membership) performs all evaluations. Hence, it would also be plausible to assume a more pronounced conflict of interest for reg- istrants under REACH than under the Cosmetics Directive. How- ever, the differences observed in the present study were not systematically related to the regulatory frameworks. In some cases, lower effect levels were observed in the evaluation under REACH, and sometimes in the evaluation under the Cosmetics Directive. Although no systematic bias was observed, the results still indicate that data selection does affect the range of effect doses. As an illus- tration, the SCCS recorded an effect at half the dose shown by the data registered under REACH in a repeated dose study after oral exposure to resorcinol (Fig. 1). Conversely, for PPD, an effect after acute oral exposure is noted in data reviewed by the registrants at a dose 50 times lower than in the corresponding data reviewed by the SCCS (Fig. 1). 5.

When all compounds were examined, the Novascreen NR bER assay was considered to possess the most sensitive endpoint, though this observation was inherently influenced by data availability. For common compounds with hits in 16 estrogen agonist assays, reporter gene assay end- points were observed to be more sensitive than other assay end- points, and common ToxCast assays that employed ERb were collectively more likely to detect estrogenic chemicals at lower concentrations. Further, the NCGC Tox21 ERa LUC BG1 Agonist assay was identified as the most sensitive ToxCast in vitro assay endpoint (based on 5th centiles) for detecting an estrogenic response. However, environmental applications of this assay and others may be limited, because the MCF-7 assay was markedly more sensitive. Future efforts are necessary to examine its utility as a diagnostic tool in environmental applications. Because each in vitro assay provides relevant information for specific endpoints among the estrogenic toxicity pathway, employing a combination of in vitro assays, as is employed by ToxCast, appears quite useful for future applications to computational toxicology.

Com- parison with the threshold blood concentrations associated with the NOAELs in both Fischer 344 and Sprague\u2013Dawley rats indicate that the margin-of-exposure is at least 37-fold. The use of an internal dose metric (Cmax) rather than applied dose reduces the uncertainty around the temporary ADI considerably since it intrinsically accounts for intra-species and inter-species differ- ences in toxicokinetics and liver effects. Therefore the current data support replacement of the temporary ADI of 0.01 mg/kg/day by a (permanent) ADI of at least 1.0 mg/kg/day for low- and medium- viscosity mineral oils.

The two dis- cussed guidelines differ substantially in this case. The HB docu- ment pertains repeatedly to a separate guideline dedicated solely to the topic of bioanalytical method validation, while the AB docu- ment lacks any reference to the rules contained in that guideline. In this respect these two documents should be entirely convergent and consistent, because it is expected by both the Sponsors and ex- perts that evaluate documentation created according to the agency guidelines. At the moment, however, there are large discrepancies and lack of harmonization of certain rules and requirements, or even acronyms used to define the pharmacokinetic parameters. That makes it much harder to design and to report the pharmaco- kinetic studies, and in extreme cases even prevents their unequiv- ocal assessment by the experts. Both the Sponsors and experts evaluating the documents find numerous fragments of the AB guideline to be difficult to use in practice. When using the veteri- nary line, the experts who want to recall the basic principles for the BE studies design are forced to quote other guidelines. This of- ten applies to guidelines of other agencies, usually much older than the contemporary document. Many details that the AB guideline omits are included in the new HB guideline and were present in many other guidelines from the last 20 years. Most have not been adopted by the AB document, even though they are the product of many years of work of many teams and specialists from various agencies in the regulatory affairs field. This document is currently in force. The content and the scope of the subsequent documents are certainly going to be modified repeatedly if only because of the continuous progress in the bioanalytics sphere and the expec- tations of the \u2018\u2018users\u2019\u2019.

The 5-HMF and OMBF are inevitable by-products of pharmaceutical preparations contain- ing sugars, such as dextrose injection and TCMIs containing saccharides. Our present study indicates that both 5-HMF and OMBF have immunosensitizing potential. TCMIs, a preparation widely used in the clinic in China, consist of complex compo- nents and have been reported to induce IDHRs and autoimmune disorders (Ho and Lai, 2004; Ji et al., 2009). Both 5-HMF and OMBF may play a role in causing IDHRs or autoimmune disorders by TCMIs containing sugars. In particular, the OMBF used to merely serve as a visible evidence of the generation of 5-HMF should receive much more attention, because OMBF may act as a neo-antigen or neo-epitope in drug-induced immune disor- ders. We have established a method of rapid screening and quality evaluation for the 5-HMF and OMBF in dextrose injection and commercially available TCMIs using LC-MS/MS (Zang et al., 2013). Taken together, these results suggest that exposure to 5- HMF and OMBF may represent a safety concern for humans, and removal of 5-HMF and OMBF from TCMIs may improve the safety of the clinical use of TCMIs.

Although differences in the patterns of sensitivity from country to country make it unlikely that a single list of allergens will be appropriate for all jurisdic- tions, it is important that a consistent risk assessment framework be used to develop each list. This will also facilitate a systematic identification of important data gaps and information needs. For example, while a great deal of effort has been devoted to character- izing distributions of sensitivities in food allergic populations, very little is known about the dietary patterns for these individuals. Similarly, while substantial work has been done on detecting and measuring allergens in foods, there are only a few studies on the prevalence and levels of undeclared allergens in a wide variety of foods.

This could be due to listing in the Pharmaceutical Schedule being refused or the drug being on the ex- tensive waiting list to be considered for inclusion in the Schedule; 41% of the drugs identified as being unavailable are included in a list of medicines given a positive recommendation for funding by PHARMAC's Pharmacology and Therapeutics Advisory Committee but awaiting ad- dition to the Schedule (Della Barca, 2018). Thus, only 45% of the new therapeutic drugs approved in Canada between 2002 and 2017 were generally available for prescribing in New Zealand in the middle of 2018. Regulatory approval occurred first in Canada for 77% of the drugs approved in both countries, with a median delay between Canadian and New Zealand approval of 10 months and 25% of the drugs having a delay of more than 21 months. Less than 10% of anti-cancer drugs and drugs for rare disorders were approved first in New Zealand.

GHS subcat- egories 1A and 1B cannot be adequately modeled. In the case of TIMES-SS, skin transformations are calculated in a separate step, in DEREK and Toxtree the alert definition includes precursor struc- tures. Predictions are not helpful for substances containing rare functional groups, structural features and atoms. In general, mod- els that are based on or include mechanistic knowledge perform better than purely statistical models. All mechanistic models for chemicals follow the theory that either the parent or its metabolite or autoxidation product will bind to skin proteins. This has recently been summarized by OECD in the adverse outcome pathway (AOP). Indeed, especially the protein binding alerts of the OASIS module of the OECD QSAR toolbox was a good indicator for a sensitization hazard. Absence of sensitizing properties was not satisfactorily predicted with the exception of the hybrid model TIMES-SS. How- ever, the latter model has such a strict domain definition that it covered only 16% of the tested substances. This paper aims at eval- uating the in silico methods under \u2018\u2018real life\u2019\u2019 conditions, in which assessments are made by toxicologists with a chemical training but are not highly trained (Q)SAR specialists, and in which data from industrial chemicals is used. Classification as a skin sensitizer according to GHS criteria has a strong impact on handling and application of the pure substance and its formulations. A false po- sitive prediction may trigger the use of burdensome personal pro- tective equipment or render the chemical unsuitable for an application where it has a good technical performance. A false neg- ative prediction can lead to skin sensitization of both workers and consumers. Both scenarios are not acceptable. Regardless of the in silico method used, the sensitization potentials of all test sub- stances could not be reliably predicted (Fig. 1). Due to different limitations, only a subset of predictions was considered to be reli- able according to the criteria of each in silico method.

For the H2S exam- ple, the proposed model was generated from data in the time range 30m\u2013360m, but it clearly would not apply down to 0m because it would predict a positive response for zero exposure duration. For comparison, a model the same as the proposed model except with a logarith- mic transformation of time was fit time to the same data (referred to as the log-time model in the text). The log- time model is a reasonable candidate for a single model to fit the data down to t = 0 and it leads to the c\u2013t rela- tionship of the form hypothesized by ten Berge et al. (1986), namely, cnt, commonly assumed. The proposed model provided a little better statistical fit to the data in the observed range of times (30m\u2013360m) and also per- formed a little better in predicting the limited observa- tions at the shorter times of 5m and 10m. Limited evidence, however, suggests that neither model may extrapolate well below or above the exposure times of the observed range used for model fitting (30m\u2013360m). In particular, this outcome suggests the hypothesis that the relationship between mortality, concentration, and time may be different at very short times, somewhere less than 30m, which are of interest in exposure guidelines. If that is the case, it would have implications for extrapo- lating risk estimates much below a time of 30m using either model. In this example, the proposed approach served to suggest an hypothesis that might be addressed further from the biological perspective.

The similar findings obtained both in Phase I and II, in an internationally and culturally diverse population, sug- gest that this NOAEL can be safely used globally.

When openly meet- ing these criteria, science speaks for itself and needs little or no argument to persuade. With this in mind, it should be intuitive that equitable and acceptable discussions ought to seek a balance of expertises and of biases. Yet, another significant problem comes to mind, firmly entangled with the adversarial climate that conflict of interest ten- sions have created. It has to do with the incapacity of most actors in a discussion to be constructively skeptical, while being inquisi- tive about uncertainties. Even for trained scientists, the tendency is to insist on defending personal position with intransigence, rather than to cooperate in discovering the reasons for ambiguities and in finding possible remedies. Discussions often end up as contact sport matches, with heightened animosities and the impasse of frozen stances. A linked problem is that data derived from long-term bioassays, from complex analytical instruments, or from epidemiologic sur- veys, are usually presented in numerical format. Digital data are then regularly interpreted as having an inherent validity of quanti- tative precision and certainty, as if they were directly transferable to any application. It is within such predicaments that conflict of interest issues should be viewed and become relevant. Given that biases are pervasive, and honoring the constitutional foundations of a free democracy, it should be abhorrent and counterproductive to repress or exclude any voice\u2014and especially voices capable of contributing to open discussions aiming to qualify uncertainty, prudence, and precaution. Still, in a time when candor is often invoked but selectively exercised, it could be seen as sensible that potential personal biases should be disclosed, in a manner similar to the practice of most scientific publications. All participants at the initial meeting of discussion panels would be invited to make personal disclo- sures, in an informal and verbal manner and in a spirit of trust. The exercise could both motivate individuals to know and moder- ate their own biases, and to alert other participants to those biases. Disclosures would become part of a panel\u2019s official minutes, and thus would acquire quasi-legal connotations to induce transparency.

Adopting such measures may seem revolutionary, but undeniably it would improve the balance of outcomes, for the current process of stifling or excluding certain voices surely distorts the balance by favoring the biases left around a table.", "Acknowledgement": "Acknowledgment The author wishes to declare his own biases, having been a member or advisor of government and of public and private enti- ties for many decades.

Regulatory decisions and the development of rational and effective cancer prevention policies depend on scientifically sound and unbiased assessments of carcinogenic potential. When the rodent tumor data from the glyphosate studies relied upon by IARC are properly eval- uated, the classification of glyphosate as a probable human carcinogen is not consistent with IARC criteria and should be retracted or revised. Erroneous carcinogen classifications like that of glyphosate raise ser- ious questions about IARC Monographs Program procedures, including the criteria for selecting Working Group Members (Erren, 2011, McLaughlin et al., 2011, McLaughlin and Tarone, 2013, Tarone, 2018). There are a variety of cognitive biases that affect the dynamics of consensus decision making by ad hoc deliberative bodies such as Monograph Working Groups (Bikhchandani et al., 1998, Brown, 2000, Erren, 2011, Lorenz et al., 2011, Sunstein, 2006). Scientists are not immune to the influence of information cascades, reputational cas- cades, and availability cascades that can influence the dynamics of deliberations in ad hoc deliberative bodies, and such problems are ex- acerbated in IARC Working Groups when the selection criteria for membership produce conditions conducive to group-think (Brown, 2000, Sunstein, 2006). If Working Group membership is restricted so that only one side of a controversy is promoted in deliberations, or one side is promoted much more strongly than the other side, then the outcome of the deliberations can virtually be preordained. The systematic exclusion by IARC of re- searchers with real or perceived industry conflicts of interest decreases the likelihood that the strongest arguments defending a suspect agent against claims of carcinogenicity will be presented and discussed during Working Group deliberations, and thus increases the probability that the agent will be classified as posing a carcinogenic hazard to humans, regardless of the strength or weakness of evidence supporting that conclusion. In fact, the current IARC Monographs Program process seems at times to be akin to a criminal trial with a prosecutor and a biased jury, but no defense counsel. Many types of competing interests, not just corporate or financial interests, pose a threat to the integrity of the IARC Monographs Program. The Monographs Program should seek to include researchers with dissenting opinions in Working Groups; conflicts of interest should be clearly identified, but not used to automatically exclude potential participants (May, 2011, Rothman, 1993). The approach taken by IARC leadership and IARC defenders to reject such concerns as unfounded and to argue by authority that current IARC Monograph procedures cannot be improved (Infante et al., 2018, Pearce et al., 2015, Wild and Cogliano, 2011, Wild and Straif, 2011) serves only to undermine the long-term scientific value of the IARC Monographs Program, and does not serve the best interests of regulatory decision making or public health.

The measure is intended to facil- itate the control of materials that present not only a substantial hazard, with the potential for serious, long term and irreversible human health effects, but also a hazard where the risk is difficult to manage. The danger associated with measures such as this is that there may be \u2018mission creep\u2019 and an appetite to include within the SVHC category chemicals that may represent a human health hazard, but not one that is consistent with the original intentions of the measure. The consequence can be that the currency of SVHC is thereby devalued, as it becomes clear that there are chemicals being assigned to the category that are not regarded as being seri- ous, irreversible and poorly managed human health risks. Accord- ingly, it is very important that the process adopted to identify a substance as a SVHC is rigorous, transparent and uses evidence- based criteria that are understood and consistent with the aim of the legislation. As illustrated in this overview, it is possible that there may be extremely rare occasions when the impact of a sen- sitising chemical is such that a discussion of its potential for cate- gorisation as a SVHC is warranted and legitimate. Key to this is evidence of long-lasting and serious impairment of QoL that is unlikely to be reversed by avoidance of further exposure (and where the necessary avoidance does not itself result in a marked deterioration in QoL). Ultimately, a default categorisation of either skin or respiratory sensitisers as SVHC is neither desirable nor appropriate, and would lead inevitably to an increasing disregard of the importance of SVHC as an indicator of the highest level of health concern.

Uncertainties Acknowledgments Conflicts of interest Transparency document References", "Acknowledgement": "The carcinogenic MOA weight-of-evidence also has associated uncertainty. New scientific data continue to be generated and published and it is possible that future studies appearing in the scientific peer-reviewed literature with data relevant to the MOA for CrVI-induced carcinogenesis due to oral exposure could affect the scientific interpretation and/or weight of prior scientific data. Additionally, while the CrVI MOA research project has been rather extensive and was designed to fill data gaps in the scientific un- derstanding of the carcinogenic MOA, it can always be said that residual scientific uncertainty remains. Readers are referred to the individual MOA studies and analyses for discussions of the associ- ated limitations by the respective study authors (e.g., Thompson et al., 2011a, 2011b, 2012, 2013a; Kirman et al., 2012, 2013; Proctor et al., 2012; Kopec et al., 2012a, 2012b; O'Brien et al., 2013; Thompson et al., 2015a, 2015c; McCarroll et al., 2010). However, the existence of some degree of uncertainty in a given area does not change the weight-of-evidence for the most scientifically-supported MOA based on the information currently available, which supports the non-linear threshold (i.e., RfD) approach as the most scientifically-defensible, non-linear approach. Nevertheless, in regard to uncertainty surrounding the carcinogenic MOA, Haney (2015b) evaluated what the potential excess risk could be at various RfD values in the event that a weight-of-evidence finding for a non-mutagenic MOA were incor- rect, accounting for dose-dependent differences in absorption by target tissues. Results indicated that despite the weight-of- evidence for a non-mutagenic MOA, if the MOA was assumed to bemutagenic, estimates of the potential risk associated with an RfD of 0.003 mg/kg-day (excess risk of 1.8E-04 to 3E-04) would be near the upper end of the USEPA acceptable excess risk range and lower than the risk associated with the arsenic federal MCL (excess risk of 5E-04 at 10 ppb).

More specifically, it is unknown whether hazard information of nanomaterials of the same element but (slightly) different characteristics (size, surface chemistry, shape) can be used together in the risk assessment. Or whether hazard information of a nanomaterial can be used in the risk assessment for which the exposure is to a material with (slightly) different characteristics. This issue links to the informa- tion requirements for risk assessment of nanomaterials, and thus to the implementation of the definition in the various regulatory frameworks. As this problem cannot be solved in short term, it is recommended to make it a research priority.

In the cases where data are avail- able, these are generally not representative of the European popu- lation. As the assessment of consumer exposure in the context of the REACH Regulation must cover the whole EU population, it is clearly desirable to use information on product use in Europe in the assessments. Extensive surveys, ideally sampling representa- tive populations/patterns of behaviour within the EU, would be needed to compile data and derive more robust default values. Surveys should primarily focus on the critical parameters identi- fied in this article, such as the amount of product used, the use fre- quency and the skin contact area (also see discussion above). Ultimately, the required data are \u2013 for many products and articles to be assessed under the REACH Regulation \u2013 similar to the \u2018\u2018habits & practices\u2019\u2019 data for washing and cleaning products (HERA, 2005) and more recent use data collected for fuels and lubricants (CONCAWE, 2014). In order to allow for a scientific discussion, these data should be gathered according to established procedures and protocols and made publicly available in a transparent way.

While benefitting from good compliance inherent in a confinement trial, participants were allowed limited alcoholic beverages during evening meals, a feature 77% of participants choose to use. Another feature was use of a controlled diet, low in potentially confounding biomarkers (i.e., PAHs, AAs, and cyanogens). Recognizing that some smokers will Dual use cigarettes with various smokeless tobacco products (STPs), a Dual use cohort was included that restricted their CPD by 60% to standardize reduced smoking rates. Randomi- zation of participants into the 6 groups was well balanced, given that no statistical differences were observed at baseline between groups for the primary clinical parameters of cigarette smoke exposure, namely: blood COHb%, urinary T-NicEq and plasma nic- otine and cotinine concentrations. Results demonstrate that when active smokers switch to exclu- sive use of Snus, Sticks, Strips, or Orbs, after 5 days their biomark- ers of exposure to toxicants in cigarette smoke were substantially and significantly reduced, usually comparable in magnitude to being tobacco abstinent. Similarly, when smoking rates are reduced by 60% in Dual users, significant but less robust toxicant reductions are still evident. In a similar biomarker study of Dual users of cigarettes and Snus, the authors suggest that Dual use does not result in compensatory changes in the way each cigarette was smoked, but do acknowledge the lack of data where a systematic assessment of cigarette smoke exposure during Dual use is avail- able (Sarkar et al., 2009). This trial did include such an assessment and results indicate that MLE did increase on a per cigarette basis, but when participants reduced their CPD by 60%, their daily \u2018tar\u2019 and nicotine MLE was reduced by \ufffd50%, indicating a net benefit in reduced toxicant exposures under these product use conditions.", "Acknowledgement": "Acknowledgments The authors wish to thank Dr. Tao Jin for his contributions to the manuscript, and to acknowledge and thank all the various con- tracted personnel involved in performing this clinical trial at: Cov- ance Clinical Research Unit Inc., Madison WI for trial conduct and data analysis; Analytisch-Biologisches Forschungslabor (ABF), Munich, Germany for bioanalytical analysis; Labstat International ULC, Ontario, Canada for yield-in-use and Snus-after-use analysis; and Covance Laboratories Ltd., Harrogate, United Kingdom for urine mutagenicity analysis.

EPAR compliance to tem cases, a lack of commitment by applicants in allocating resources to ERA-related issues during the procedure. This may also reflect the fact that, according to the current pharmaceutical legislation, the Environmental Risk Assessment is not a criterion to be taken into account when recommending the granting of a marketing authorisation. On the other hand, the Directive also foresees that, if concerns on the environmental effects derived from the human use of a medicinal product are present, precautionary safety mea- sures are to be taken for its storage, its administration to patients and for its disposal. This led in the past to specific actions, such as the recommendation to include in the package a specific disposal container (sachet) for used products for which an impact on the environment was highlighted. 5. Conclusions This review thus highlights relevant aspects of the current state-of-practise for ERA evaluation of new active substances con- tained in medicinal products and shortcomings frequently encoun- tered. These results show the need for continued efforts to be placed on environmental aspects in the context of drug develop- ment and evaluation procedures for medicinal products for human use.

Herein before presented, the selection of certain preparations cov- ers the different strategies i.e.: LHRD, toxicological limit values, TTC, food regulation data or consideration of unavoidable background exposure. Calculations assuming a usual dosage of approximately 1 ml or 1 g (dilution or trituration) daily of the finished homeo- pathic medicinal products are based on sufficiently conservative assumptions. The concept of a FSD and the application of the PtC on Non-Clinical Safety, 2007, are providing a rather general ap- proach with distinctly conservative overall potencies related to 10 g or 10 ml of preparation. For specific homeopathic medicinal products with specific data available, an appropriate safety evalua- tion using the approaches and considerations presented in this pa- per is reasonably practicable. The conducted exemplary calculations for selected homeopathic medicinal products indicate that a rather wide range of potencies may be considered as safe. By drawing on our practical experience and expertise, we consider it useful that if two or more different assessment routes are appli- cable, each approach should be taken into consideration and the respective outcomes should be compared, discussed and evaluated. Thus, the different evaluation strategies are more or less of equal importance and are considered a useful scientific and, at the same time, pragmatic tool in integrative safety assessment and regula- tion of homeopathic medicinal products. In view of the tremendous multitude and particular diversity of substances used in this field, the structured concept presented here provides immediately help- ful and valuable criteria for safety evaluation. It is particularly note- worthy that computational toxicology tools, so-called in slilico technologies, (Quantitative) Structure\u2013Activity Relationship ((Q)SARs) models/systems, may currently be of supportive value in predicting selected preclinical human health endpoints. In the context of scarce information on toxicological parameters, data gaps and uncertainty, attention is increasingly being paid to such predictive tools and their options are taken into account by several agencies, authorities, institutions, applicants worldwide (Valerio, 2009, 2011; Yang and Valerio, 2009; ICH Guideline M7 Step 3, 2013; Sutter et al., 2013; Schrenk et al., 2013). Given that their application in the regulatory context is at an early stage, it may be decided on a case-by-case approach if in silico technologies may be already applicable to assess a specific homeopathic medic- inal product. Essentially, due to the diversity and complexity of homeopathic medicinal products there is not a single universal ap- proach, the considerations presented here shall encourage and pro- mote further scientific and regulatory discussions addressing regulatory concepts in homeopathy all over the world.

For humans, a conservative assumption would be that one or more of the concordant adverse developmental effects would occur at an average concentration during a comparable period of susceptibility. This conservative choice of DDEF is 14. Furthermore, if mice and humans are assumed to be in steady state during the period of sus- ceptibility for any of the developmental endpoint(s) of concern, which were demonstrated in mice by Lou et al. (2009, Figure 7b) and suggested in humans after presumed continuous exposure (as demonstrated by Elcombe et al. (2014, Figure 78), then the DDEF would still be 14. Population exposures to PFOA are generally much lower than both the experimental animal data and the clinical human study. Thus, the kinetic comparison and development of the various DDEFs developed here may not be applicable to lower exposure levels in humans. However, and im- portantly, the development of these DDEFs is consistent with current guidelines5 of IPCS (2005) and EPA (2014), and the use of any of these values would lead to a different point of departure for the development of the PFOA safe dose by several federal and state authorities. PFOA is not naturally occurring, so natural background exposures are not expected. However, PFOA and related chemicals are very useful and stable, and as a result have contaminated the environment in many places to a very low level. In some places, the contaminant levels ap- proach the range of safe doses, which of themselves are highly disparate among government agencies (over 750-fold differences), with several safe doses being 100-fold lower (i.e., more toxic) than other known very toxic substances such as methyl mercury (ITER, 2019). This disparity is because international authorities approach the extrapolation of a safe dose for PFOA and related chemicals in very different manners. For example, authorities in the US tend to focus on experimental animal data and incorporate the differences in half-lives among experimental animals and humans to adjust the safe dose downward (e.g., EPA, 2016; NJDWQI, 2017; ATSDR, 2018). Some European authorities focus on human epidemiology studies with an emphasis on longer half-life in humans (European Food Safety Authority, 2018); other European authorities focus on a more traditional approach and are skeptical of the long half-life estimates of others (Committee on Toxicology, 2009). Australian and New Zealand authorities are considering several dif- ferent approaches (Food Standards Australian New Zealand, 2017; Australian Department of Health, 2017), as is Health Canada (2018). The recent kinetic findings in humans by Elcombe et al. (2013) may alleviate some of this uncertainty in the estimation of a safe dose since they can be compared to experimental data from animal studies, such as conducted here with mice, or incorporated into one or more of the various PBPK models in the future. Limitations may exist in this com- parison, however, as the kinetic data in this research are from non- pregnant mice and humans, and in the case of humans, from individuals of both sexes of different ages with advanced disease. Furthermore, PFOA measurements in humans are in plasma and in mice are in serum. However, this human population might be considered a sensitive sub- population, and if so, a corresponding change in one or more of the usual uncertainty factors might be appropriate. Estimates of half-life may also be possible from Elcombe et al. (2013, Figure 78), but these estimates appear to be much shorter than literature estimates inferred from chronic exposures of workers and other populations as described by EPA (2016) and others. The variability in estimates might be due to a biphasic elimination evident in the clinical trial where ~5\u201320\u03bcM appears to be the inflection point in humans (e.g., see Figure 10 of Elcombe et al., 2013), and in mice (Lou et al., 2009) based on potential saturation of resorption of PFOA in the kidney at high doses. Such saturation might not be expected in the general population exposed to much lower doses. Or, this difference might be because the clinical trials are for cancer therapy, and kinetics in humans from these situations may not reflect the average po- pulation as mentioned above. Regardless, exploration of these clinical data should provide additional insight to half-life estimates in humans, especially since one or more of the PBPK models already incorporate a biphasic ap- proach (Wambaugh et al., 2013). The DDEF/CSAF method explicitly addresses human uncertainty, specifically in the use of data for replacing default uncertainty factors for experimental animals to human extrapolation and from average to sensitive human extrapolation. The DDEF/CSAF method explicitly ad- dresses the calculation of a RfD, RfC, TDI, or similar \u201csafe\u201d dose values. While such values cannot be used to determine risk, or perhaps risk other than zero, they are very useful for identifying ranges of exposures likely to be without the risk of deleterious effects in sensitive subgroups after a lifetime of exposure as described by Health Canada (Meek et al., 1994), IPCS (2005) and EPA (2014). The DDEF/CSAFmethod has been used and further developed under the guidance of several authorities and numerous experts. It has been used in- ternationally since the mid-1990s. Recently, the IPCS (Bhat et al., 2017) has surveyed its membership on the use of this method. Results of this survey are generally positive as found at: https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/ 10.1080/10408444.2017.1303818. We use this method here to explore the appropriate dosimetric adjustment when developmental toxicity is the cri- tical effect. We find that in addition to Cmax and AUC, a comparison of the average concentrations during the periods of susceptibility for develop- mental endpoints is also important.

This value would be 2.5 under in IPCS (2005). 5 Either guideline suggests using the kinetics of the experimental animal in the range of the NOAEL/BMD/LOAEL and for humans the lowest available exposure where sufficient data are available. A dose of 1.0mg/kg-day was chosen in mice from Lau et al. (2006), which is found to be the LOAEL in Table 1 for several (although not all) developmental effects. For humans, be- cause the kinetics for the various doses in Elcombe et al. (2013) appear similar, an average kinetic value from Table 5 is used for the comparison, which also is associated with an average dose of about 1mg/kg-day. Using a specific lower or higher human dose would change the DDEF of 14 only slightly in either di- rection (e.g., use of a dose of 0.1 from Table 5 would yield a DDEF of 15). M.L. Dourson, et al.

(2013) may alleviate some of this uncertainty in the estimation of a safe dose since they can be compared to experimental data from animal studies, such as conducted here with mice, or incorporated into one or more of the various PBPK models in the future. Limitations may exist in this com- parison, however, as the kinetic data in this research are from non- pregnant mice and humans, and in the case of humans, from individuals of both sexes of different ages with advanced disease. Furthermore, PFOA measurements in humans are in plasma and in mice are in serum. However, this human population might be considered a sensitive sub- population, and if so, a corresponding change in one or more of the usual uncertainty factors might be appropriate. Estimates of half-life may also be possible from Elcombe et al. (2013, Figure 78), but these estimates appear to be much shorter than literature estimates inferred from chronic exposures of workers and other populations as described by EPA (2016) and others. The variability in estimates might be due to a biphasic elimination evident in the clinical trial where ~5\u201320\u03bcM appears to be the inflection point in humans (e.g., see Figure 10 of Elcombe et al., 2013), and in mice (Lou et al., 2009) based on potential saturation of resorption of PFOA in the kidney at high doses. Such saturation might not be expected in the general population exposed to much lower doses. Or, this difference might be because the clinical trials are for cancer therapy, and kinetics in humans from these situations may not reflect the average po- pulation as mentioned above. Regardless, exploration of these clinical data should provide additional insight to half-life estimates in humans, especially since one or more of the PBPK models already incorporate a biphasic ap- proach (Wambaugh et al., 2013). The DDEF/CSAF method explicitly addresses human uncertainty, specifically in the use of data for replacing default uncertainty factors for experimental animals to human extrapolation and from average to sensitive human extrapolation. The DDEF/CSAF method explicitly ad- dresses the calculation of a RfD, RfC, TDI, or similar \u201csafe\u201d dose values. While such values cannot be used to determine risk, or perhaps risk other than zero, they are very useful for identifying ranges of exposures likely to be without the risk of deleterious effects in sensitive subgroups after a lifetime of exposure as described by Health Canada (Meek et al., 1994), IPCS (2005) and EPA (2014). The DDEF/CSAFmethod has been used and further developed under the guidance of several authorities and numerous experts. It has been used in- ternationally since the mid-1990s. Recently, the IPCS (Bhat et al., 2017) has surveyed its membership on the use of this method. Results of this survey are generally positive as found at: https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/ 10.1080/10408444.2017.1303818. We use this method here to explore the appropriate dosimetric adjustment when developmental toxicity is the cri- tical effect. We find that in addition to Cmax and AUC, a comparison of the average concentrations during the periods of susceptibility for develop- mental endpoints is also important.

This value would be 2.5 under in IPCS (2005). 5 Either guideline suggests using the kinetics of the experimental animal in the range of the NOAEL/BMD/LOAEL and for humans the lowest available exposure where sufficient data are available. A dose of 1.0mg/kg-day was chosen in mice from Lau et al. (2006), which is found to be the LOAEL in Table 1 for several (although not all) developmental effects. For humans, be- cause the kinetics for the various doses in Elcombe et al. (2013) appear similar, an average kinetic value from Table 5 is used for the comparison, which also is associated with an average dose of about 1mg/kg-day. Using a specific lower or higher human dose would change the DDEF of 14 only slightly in either di- rection (e.g., use of a dose of 0.1 from Table 5 would yield a DDEF of 15). M.L. Dourson, et al.

The higher the metabolism (reduction), the higher the mutage- nicity potential.

Finally, the ability to resist reduction by human nitro- reductases may be used as a criterion to select nitro compounds with no-mutagenicity potential during the drug development process.

Discussion Neurotoxicity in rats is known to correlate well with concentrations of pyrethroid in brain and plasma at the time-to-peak-effect and/or the tmax (time of the maximal concentrations) following gavage adminis- tration of bifenthrin, lambda- and gamma-cyhalothrin (Scollon et al., 2011; Moser et al., 2016). Due to slower food intake over a few hours by dietary administration vs. bolus dose by gavage, coupled with rapid metabolism and clearance, pyrethroids do not reach as high a peak level at the target tissues from dietary exposure as gavage doses and thus the degree of acute toxicity in dietary studies is far less than for gavage doses. As a consequence, acute NOAELs from gavage studies are much lower than from dietary studies. Although points of departure for a large number of neurotoxic pesticides are currently set by regulatory authorities based on endpoints from acute gavage neurotoxicity studies in young adult animals, direct dosing of pups during lactation to gen- erate a lower offspring NOAEL is not relevant and too conservative knowing human infants will never encounter such an exposure scenario under actual conditions of pesticide use. That approach may be ap- plicable for a pediatric drug, but it is inappropriate and too con- servative for a pesticide. In the definitive zeta-cypermethrin DNT study, the only effects on offspring were decreases in pups\u2019 weights and body weight gains. This is consistent with effects observed in DNT studies for 5 other pyrethroids where decreases in pup weight, pup weight gain and/or brain weight were noted at the LOAEL with or without indications of neurotoxicity, suggesting that body weight changes are more (or equally) sensitive indicators of toxicity in the pups than are neurological effects in all 6 pyrethroids DNT studies (US EPA, 2010; Shafer et al., 2005). It is well understood that the method of administration (e.g., dietary vs. gavage) is a key determinant of toxicity: either Cmax or AUC could be more relevant to toxicity depending on the nature of toxicity and could have important implications for study design and human health risk assess- ment. As mentioned earlier, pyrethroid neurotoxicity is likely to be a function of peak target tissue or plasma concentrations (Cmax), and ef- fects on body weight and other toxicities are more likely a function of AUC. In this paper, we established a conservative relative TK of 3.1X for juveniles versus adults based on both Cmax and AUC values from the TK study, and used the internal exposure data (Cmax) obtained at a single point considered to be at tmax from two range-finding DNT studies to reflect both peak exposure and overall accumulative exposure for zeta- cypermethrin. This relative TK factor of 3.1X is similar to the safety factor of 3X which is typically applied to adjust for TK differences be- tween juvenile and adult human for setting points of departure. The definitive dietary DNT study in combination with the TK data provided full characterization of DNT potential of zeta-cypermethrin including maternal, fetal and offspring internal exposure, and maternal and offspring external exposure dose. Therefore, dietary method of administration in rats is the most relevant method to human exposure scenario and the duration of exposure used in the dietary study is also appropriate to detect developmental neurotoxicity relevant to humans, since it covers exposure to test substance during critical gestation and postnatal periods of nervous system development. In these studies, the exposure to the test substance in utero and postnatally were confirmed by plasma concentrations data obtained on GD 20, LD 5 and LD 21. The combined use of TK data from the DNT studies and the current TK study allowed us to calculate the offspring external dose to characterize both internal and external exposure. The calculated offspring external dose is considered more accurate than rough estimates based on milk con- centrations and default milk consumption and body weights of pups during the rapid postnatal developmental phase in rats. Furthermore, it provides a more conservative and realistic offspring NOAEL than those currently extrapolated by authorities based on end points from dams.

Z. Liu, et al. Regulatory Toxicology and Pharmacology 108 (2019) 104425 6 The calculated conservative offspring NOAEL that utilizes internal ex- posure values from a dietary DNT study should be protective of all human populations including infants and children. For the DNT studies that have been performed previously without age-related TK data for other pyrethroids, it would be reasonable to conduct TK studies with far fewer animals to obtain a relative TK factor and use them to calculate a conservative offspring NOAEL. The TK study would enhance the values of those existing studies and reduce animal use by not re-running new DNT studies with full treatment regimens with TK groups. There is sufficient evidence that shows the increased susceptibility of juvenile versus adult rats to pyrethroid toxicity is due to age-de- pendent toxicokinetic rather than toxicodynamic differences (Sheets, 2000; Anand et al., 2006). The recent TK data with zeta-cypermethrin also confirmed that PND 11 rats had higher internal exposure than PND 21, and PND 21 had higher internal exposure than PND 90 female rats as reflected by the Cmax and AUC values after the same dose levels at 0.25 or 0.75mg/kg. It should also be recognized that there is significant species differences in the metabolism of pyrethroids between rats and humans. For example, bifenthrin was shown to be metabolized at a higher rate in vitro in liver microsomes of juvenile humans than those of liver microsomes of adult humans, while the opposite was true for rat liver microsomes (Nallani et al., 2018). Surprisingly, although the in- trinsic clearance of bifenthrin was faster in adult rat liver microsomes compared to that in human liver microsomes, it was slower in juvenile rat liver microsomes than in juvenile human liver microsomes. These data suggest that the direct use of pyrethroid TK data from juvenile rats is not appropriate for setting additional risk factors for children, since they are likely to be ultra conservative. In conclusion, based on age-related TK data after gavage dosing and internal exposure data from offspring and dams from the range-finding DNT dietary studies, the offspring NOAEL was calculated to be 3.2 mg/ kg/day for zeta-cypermethrin in the definitive DNT study. This calcu- lated offspring NOAEL is lower than the maternal NOAEL (9mg/kg/ day) that was set previously, therefore conservative to protect infants and children health. This approach shows that the dietary method of administration is appropriate for DNT studies when a TK component is included in the study; age-related TK data from gavage studies can be used to calculate a conservative offspring NOAEL based on maternal NOAEL; if the offspring NOAEL is used for risk assessment, perhaps the additional safety factor of 3X is not necessary since the PODs derived by this approach has already taken into consideration both TK and tox- icodynamic differences between juvenile and adult rats. A similar ap- proach can be used for determining more appropriate offspring NOAELs for the other pyrethroids where the dietary DNT studies have been conducted without a age-related TK component.

Discussion Neurotoxicity in rats is known to correlate well with concentrations of pyrethroid in brain and plasma at the time-to-peak-effect and/or the tmax (time of the maximal concentrations) following gavage adminis- tration of bifenthrin, lambda- and gamma-cyhalothrin (Scollon et al., 2011; Moser et al., 2016). Due to slower food intake over a few hours by dietary administration vs. bolus dose by gavage, coupled with rapid metabolism and clearance, pyrethroids do not reach as high a peak level at the target tissues from dietary exposure as gavage doses and thus the degree of acute toxicity in dietary studies is far less than for gavage doses. As a consequence, acute NOAELs from gavage studies are much lower than from dietary studies. Although points of departure for a large number of neurotoxic pesticides are currently set by regulatory authorities based on endpoints from acute gavage neurotoxicity studies in young adult animals, direct dosing of pups during lactation to gen- erate a lower offspring NOAEL is not relevant and too conservative knowing human infants will never encounter such an exposure scenario under actual conditions of pesticide use. That approach may be ap- plicable for a pediatric drug, but it is inappropriate and too con- servative for a pesticide. In the definitive zeta-cypermethrin DNT study, the only effects on offspring were decreases in pups\u2019 weights and body weight gains. This is consistent with effects observed in DNT studies for 5 other pyrethroids where decreases in pup weight, pup weight gain and/or brain weight were noted at the LOAEL with or without indications of neurotoxicity, suggesting that body weight changes are more (or equally) sensitive indicators of toxicity in the pups than are neurological effects in all 6 pyrethroids DNT studies (US EPA, 2010; Shafer et al., 2005). It is well understood that the method of administration (e.g., dietary vs. gavage) is a key determinant of toxicity: either Cmax or AUC could be more relevant to toxicity depending on the nature of toxicity and could have important implications for study design and human health risk assess- ment. As mentioned earlier, pyrethroid neurotoxicity is likely to be a function of peak target tissue or plasma concentrations (Cmax), and ef- fects on body weight and other toxicities are more likely a function of AUC. In this paper, we established a conservative relative TK of 3.1X for juveniles versus adults based on both Cmax and AUC values from the TK study, and used the internal exposure data (Cmax) obtained at a single point considered to be at tmax from two range-finding DNT studies to reflect both peak exposure and overall accumulative exposure for zeta- cypermethrin. This relative TK factor of 3.1X is similar to the safety factor of 3X which is typically applied to adjust for TK differences be- tween juvenile and adult human for setting points of departure. The definitive dietary DNT study in combination with the TK data provided full characterization of DNT potential of zeta-cypermethrin including maternal, fetal and offspring internal exposure, and maternal and offspring external exposure dose. Therefore, dietary method of administration in rats is the most relevant method to human exposure scenario and the duration of exposure used in the dietary study is also appropriate to detect developmental neurotoxicity relevant to humans, since it covers exposure to test substance during critical gestation and postnatal periods of nervous system development. In these studies, the exposure to the test substance in utero and postnatally were confirmed by plasma concentrations data obtained on GD 20, LD 5 and LD 21. The combined use of TK data from the DNT studies and the current TK study allowed us to calculate the offspring external dose to characterize both internal and external exposure. The calculated offspring external dose is considered more accurate than rough estimates based on milk con- centrations and default milk consumption and body weights of pups during the rapid postnatal developmental phase in rats. Furthermore, it provides a more conservative and realistic offspring NOAEL than those currently extrapolated by authorities based on end points from dams.

For the DNT studies that have been performed previously without age-related TK data for other pyrethroids, it would be reasonable to conduct TK studies with far fewer animals to obtain a relative TK factor and use them to calculate a conservative offspring NOAEL. The TK study would enhance the values of those existing studies and reduce animal use by not re-running new DNT studies with full treatment regimens with TK groups. There is sufficient evidence that shows the increased susceptibility of juvenile versus adult rats to pyrethroid toxicity is due to age-de- pendent toxicokinetic rather than toxicodynamic differences (Sheets, 2000; Anand et al., 2006). The recent TK data with zeta-cypermethrin also confirmed that PND 11 rats had higher internal exposure than PND 21, and PND 21 had higher internal exposure than PND 90 female rats as reflected by the Cmax and AUC values after the same dose levels at 0.25 or 0.75mg/kg. It should also be recognized that there is significant species differences in the metabolism of pyrethroids between rats and humans. For example, bifenthrin was shown to be metabolized at a higher rate in vitro in liver microsomes of juvenile humans than those of liver microsomes of adult humans, while the opposite was true for rat liver microsomes (Nallani et al., 2018). Surprisingly, although the in- trinsic clearance of bifenthrin was faster in adult rat liver microsomes compared to that in human liver microsomes, it was slower in juvenile rat liver microsomes than in juvenile human liver microsomes. These data suggest that the direct use of pyrethroid TK data from juvenile rats is not appropriate for setting additional risk factors for children, since they are likely to be ultra conservative. In conclusion, based on age-related TK data after gavage dosing and internal exposure data from offspring and dams from the range-finding DNT dietary studies, the offspring NOAEL was calculated to be 3.2 mg/ kg/day for zeta-cypermethrin in the definitive DNT study. This calcu- lated offspring NOAEL is lower than the maternal NOAEL (9mg/kg/ day) that was set previously, therefore conservative to protect infants and children health. This approach shows that the dietary method of administration is appropriate for DNT studies when a TK component is included in the study; age-related TK data from gavage studies can be used to calculate a conservative offspring NOAEL based on maternal NOAEL; if the offspring NOAEL is used for risk assessment, perhaps the additional safety factor of 3X is not necessary since the PODs derived by this approach has already taken into consideration both TK and tox- icodynamic differences between juvenile and adult rats. A similar ap- proach can be used for determining more appropriate offspring NOAELs for the other pyrethroids where the dietary DNT studies have been conducted without a age-related TK component.

Discussion Neurotoxicity in rats is known to correlate well with concentrations of pyrethroid in brain and plasma at the time-to-peak-effect and/or the tmax (time of the maximal concentrations) following gavage adminis- tration of bifenthrin, lambda- and gamma-cyhalothrin (Scollon et al., 2011; Moser et al., 2016). Due to slower food intake over a few hours by dietary administration vs. bolus dose by gavage, coupled with rapid metabolism and clearance, pyrethroids do not reach as high a peak level at the target tissues from dietary exposure as gavage doses and thus the degree of acute toxicity in dietary studies is far less than for gavage doses. As a consequence, acute NOAELs from gavage studies are much lower than from dietary studies. Although points of departure for a large number of neurotoxic pesticides are currently set by regulatory authorities based on endpoints from acute gavage neurotoxicity studies in young adult animals, direct dosing of pups during lactation to gen- erate a lower offspring NOAEL is not relevant and too conservative knowing human infants will never encounter such an exposure scenario under actual conditions of pesticide use. That approach may be ap- plicable for a pediatric drug, but it is inappropriate and too con- servative for a pesticide. In the definitive zeta-cypermethrin DNT study, the only effects on offspring were decreases in pups\u2019 weights and body weight gains. This is consistent with effects observed in DNT studies for 5 other pyrethroids where decreases in pup weight, pup weight gain and/or brain weight were noted at the LOAEL with or without indications of neurotoxicity, suggesting that body weight changes are more (or equally) sensitive indicators of toxicity in the pups than are neurological effects in all 6 pyrethroids DNT studies (US EPA, 2010; Shafer et al., 2005). It is well understood that the method of administration (e.g., dietary vs. gavage) is a key determinant of toxicity: either Cmax or AUC could be more relevant to toxicity depending on the nature of toxicity and could have important implications for study design and human health risk assess- ment. As mentioned earlier, pyrethroid neurotoxicity is likely to be a function of peak target tissue or plasma concentrations (Cmax), and ef- fects on body weight and other toxicities are more likely a function of AUC. In this paper, we established a conservative relative TK of 3.1X for juveniles versus adults based on both Cmax and AUC values from the TK study, and used the internal exposure data (Cmax) obtained at a single point considered to be at tmax from two range-finding DNT studies to reflect both peak exposure and overall accumulative exposure for zeta- cypermethrin. This relative TK factor of 3.1X is similar to the safety factor of 3X which is typically applied to adjust for TK differences be- tween juvenile and adult human for setting points of departure. The definitive dietary DNT study in combination with the TK data provided full characterization of DNT potential of zeta-cypermethrin including maternal, fetal and offspring internal exposure, and maternal and offspring external exposure dose. Therefore, dietary method of administration in rats is the most relevant method to human exposure scenario and the duration of exposure used in the dietary study is also appropriate to detect developmental neurotoxicity relevant to humans, since it covers exposure to test substance during critical gestation and postnatal periods of nervous system development. In these studies, the exposure to the test substance in utero and postnatally were confirmed by plasma concentrations data obtained on GD 20, LD 5 and LD 21. The combined use of TK data from the DNT studies and the current TK study allowed us to calculate the offspring external dose to characterize both internal and external exposure. The calculated offspring external dose is considered more accurate than rough estimates based on milk con- centrations and default milk consumption and body weights of pups during the rapid postnatal developmental phase in rats. Furthermore, it provides a more conservative and realistic offspring NOAEL than those currently extrapolated by authorities based on end points from dams.

For the DNT studies that have been performed previously without age-related TK data for other pyrethroids, it would be reasonable to conduct TK studies with far fewer animals to obtain a relative TK factor and use them to calculate a conservative offspring NOAEL. The TK study would enhance the values of those existing studies and reduce animal use by not re-running new DNT studies with full treatment regimens with TK groups. There is sufficient evidence that shows the increased susceptibility of juvenile versus adult rats to pyrethroid toxicity is due to age-de- pendent toxicokinetic rather than toxicodynamic differences (Sheets, 2000; Anand et al., 2006). The recent TK data with zeta-cypermethrin also confirmed that PND 11 rats had higher internal exposure than PND 21, and PND 21 had higher internal exposure than PND 90 female rats as reflected by the Cmax and AUC values after the same dose levels at 0.25 or 0.75mg/kg. It should also be recognized that there is significant species differences in the metabolism of pyrethroids between rats and humans. For example, bifenthrin was shown to be metabolized at a higher rate in vitro in liver microsomes of juvenile humans than those of liver microsomes of adult humans, while the opposite was true for rat liver microsomes (Nallani et al., 2018). Surprisingly, although the in- trinsic clearance of bifenthrin was faster in adult rat liver microsomes compared to that in human liver microsomes, it was slower in juvenile rat liver microsomes than in juvenile human liver microsomes. These data suggest that the direct use of pyrethroid TK data from juvenile rats is not appropriate for setting additional risk factors for children, since they are likely to be ultra conservative. In conclusion, based on age-related TK data after gavage dosing and internal exposure data from offspring and dams from the range-finding DNT dietary studies, the offspring NOAEL was calculated to be 3.2 mg/ kg/day for zeta-cypermethrin in the definitive DNT study. This calcu- lated offspring NOAEL is lower than the maternal NOAEL (9mg/kg/ day) that was set previously, therefore conservative to protect infants and children health. This approach shows that the dietary method of administration is appropriate for DNT studies when a TK component is included in the study; age-related TK data from gavage studies can be used to calculate a conservative offspring NOAEL based on maternal NOAEL; if the offspring NOAEL is used for risk assessment, perhaps the additional safety factor of 3X is not necessary since the PODs derived by this approach has already taken into consideration both TK and tox- icodynamic differences between juvenile and adult rats. A similar ap- proach can be used for determining more appropriate offspring NOAELs for the other pyrethroids where the dietary DNT studies have been conducted without a age-related TK component.

Rampal, J. Mohd Nizam / Regulatory Toxicology and Pharmacology 46 (2006) 131\u2013135 135 tions of factories are to be carried out regularly every 15 months. Supplementary and special inspection may be also required. While there is no oYcial statistic on compliance is available in Malaysian workplace, data showed that DOSH has carried out a total of 369 industrial hygiene inspections and more than 25,000 inspections to factories, machinery installations, and construction sites in the year 2003. The chemical industry in Malaysia approach to encour- age compliance with existing regulations is in the form of the \u201cResponsible Care Program (RCP)\u201d launched in 1994. The RCP initiated by the Chemical Industries Council of Malaysia (CICM) has developed various guiding principles and codes of practice which member companies are required to adhere to. However a number of outstanding issues including lack of trained personnel, deWciency in enforcement, right to know not assured, dependence on for- eign workers with their cultural and ethnic diVerences and the small and medium industries not having the proper infrastructure in place has posed a problem in ensuring control of exposure in the workplace (Onn, 1996). The chemical industry in Malaysia approach to encour- age compliance with existing regulations is in the form of the \u201cResponsible Care Program (RCP)\u201d launched in 1994. The RCP initiated by the Chemical Industries Council of Malaysia (CICM) has developed various guiding principles and codes of practice which member companies are required to adhere to.

In Malaysia, responsibility in ensuring safety and health of the Malaysian workforce is not solely borne by the Ministry of Human Resources. Several other govern- ment agencies are also involved particularly in enforcing legislation related to safety and health. Pesticides Act 1974 was enacted mainly to regulate and ensure safety use of pesticides especially in agriculture sector and also gen- eral public. The law particularly emphasis on control of importation and manufacture of pesticides, control of presence of pesticides in food, reporting on death or injury occasioned by pesticides and procedure in analyz- ing pesticides (Malaysia 1974). Ministry of Science, Tech- nology, and Innovation is the agency which plays an important role in enforcing Atomic Energy Licensing Act 1984 and its regulations. The Act provides regulations and control of atomic energy, establishes standards on lia- bility for nuclear damage and matters connected to it (Malaysia 1984). It lays responsibility to the licensee to provide protection of health and safety of the workers from ionizing radiation such as monitoring of exposure to ionizing radiation, providing approved personnel moni- toring devices and providing medical examination to exposed workers. In Radiation Protection (Basic Safety Standards) Regulations 1988 the standards for annual dose limit for whole body and partial body exposure of a worker to ionizing radiation are also stipulated. For example the annual dose limit for the whole body expo- sure of a worker is 50 millisieverts (mSv). SpeciWc group of workers are prohibited to work in an area that expose them to ionizing radiation including pregnant women, nursing mothers, and person under sixteen years of age (Malaysia 1988). 6. Conclusion EVective and eYcient law enforcement is particularly vital in ensuring compliance to safety and health law in the country. Nevertheless all other stakeholders also need to share this responsibility in line with the self-regulation con- cept that has been put forward by OSHA 1994. For multi- national companies operating in the country, they are highly recommended to use their own requirement and standards with regards to occupational safety and health as long as they meet minimum requirements as stipulated in the Malaysian legislation. While the eVorts of the govern- ment are commendable, eVorts by employers seem to be lacking especially those from the small and medium enter- prises. Interest to control exposures and ensuring safety and health in the workplace is slowly becoming of interest to unions. Studies have shown awareness of OSHA 1994 and its eVectiveness in meeting the objects of the Act needs to be improved and hence it is important that employers and employees know, understand and comply with the pro- visions stipulated in the legislation. To promote safety and health in the workplace it is important to ensure exposures to health hazards are regulated and well controlled. This is all the more as workplaces in the country are subjected to the phenomenon of globalization with introduction of new technologies, work organizations, work processes and sub- stances (Rampal, 2000).

Although not a one-to-one match, this approach is, in essence, very similar to a well-informed adverse outcome pathway (AOP) that includes support for a causal link between the key event and adverse outcome (Ankley et al., 2010). While Judson et al. (2013) agree that increasing the use of well characterized reference compounds is important; they de- emphasize the need for cross-laboratory testing, stressing instead the importance of data availability to enable a \u2018\u2018web-based, trans- parent, and expedited peer review process.\u2019\u2019 Based on Patlewicz et al. (2013), the analysis reported here and our recent efforts in developing AOPs, we propose a Scientific Con- fidence Framework for prediction models derived from HTS assays (Table 5). This proposed framework contains three inter-related elements: Analytical Validation, Qualification and Utilization. Together, these three elements should facilitate systematic, transparent, and objective evaluation and documentation of the scientific confidence of HTS/HCS assays and their prediction mod- els. Addressing these elements may be challenging, although it is envisioned that the manner and extent to which these need to be addressed will be context dependent. To illustrate application of the proposed Scientific Confidence Framework, we considered the Rotroff et al. (2013) report and the case study presented above. With respect to the first framework element, Analytical Validation, each of the 18 endo- crine ToxCast\u2122 assays has a defined mechanistic endpoint. In terms of accessibility to ToxCast\u2122 data to enable independent verification, or refinement of existing prediction models or development of new models, EPA\u2019s ToxCast\u2122 program is to be commended. All of the data were accessible from the ToxCast\u2122 web site or from the Supplemental Materials in the Rotroff et al. (2013) publication. However, we did not review or analyze the chemical domains of applicability or documentation of assay per- formance characteristics (reliability, sensitivity, and specificity). Such a review is important, and requires a detailed and separate analysis outside the scope of this manuscript. In terms of the second framework element, Qualification (assessment of the prediction model derived from the HTS/HCS screening assays), the Rotroff et al. (2013) HTS-derived EDSP T1S endocrine prediction models fell well short. None of the published prediction model algorithms were transparent, nor were the algo- rithms clearly defined and documented. Input from the first author was helpful, but significant efforts were still needed to reverse engineer the prediction models. For the most part, the underlying data sets were available to support this reverse engineering activ- ity, however, the precise details of how dose\u2013response data were re-coded as binary and response indicators (using an unspecified Hill function with some manual adjustment) were not documented or readily available in the Supplementary Materials. Thus, considerable unnecessary effort was required to enable indepen- dent verification. In terms of documentation of measures of good- ness-of-fit, robustness and predictivity of the prediction models, Rotroff et al. (2013), provided estimates for predictivity of classifi- cation (fitting); but unbiased performance determinations (cross validation) for prediction of as-yet unknown EDSP outcomes from ToxCast\u2122 data were not provided. Our analysis suggests that focusing the assay set to those of known biological relevance may increase the predictive performance (although not necessarily the fitting performance). With respect to use of datasets in model development, the difference between results of guideline studies vs. non-guideline studies should be noted. Based on our experience, we would recommend that toxicity study databases assembled for use in constructing predictive modeling should be curated by experienced toxicologists, with a particular focus on defining study quality and data reliability using a predetermined set of criteria that allow for identification of positive versus nega- tive responses based on accepted toxicological principles. How- ever, the models still must be used with caution because the domain of applicability \u2013 the structural space of substances used to construct these classification and prediction models \u2013 is cur- rently limited to 21 chemicals for estrogen pathways and 14 for androgen pathways. Thus, research and development needs to con- tinue to develop data sets and prediction models, before prediction models derived from HTS/HCS results can be used as standalone algorithms to predict in vivo endocrine endpoints. Regarding the third element of the framework, Utilization, Rotroff et al. (2013) indicate the intent is to use these models to \u2018\u2018predict components of EDSP T1S and related results.\u2019\u2019 First, we agree with Rotroff et al. (2013), that current ToxCast results are inadequate to predict S and T responses. For E and A, our analysis shows that because these models were developed using fitting, they fall short in truly predicting EDSP Tier 1 E and A in vivo results. 450 Louis Anthony (Tony) Cox et al. / Regulatory Toxicology and Pharmacology 69 (2014) 443\u2013450 Nevertheless, the balanced accuracies of both the classification (fitting) and cross validation models for E and A activities signal significant advancement in developing biologically-based HTS/ HCS-derived models for E and A endocrine activities. Yet, with respect to regulatory use, a number of questions still must be addressed concerning the acceptable range of predictivity (balanced accuracy) of an E or A prediction model necessary to use for a given purpose. How accurate must predictivity be for prioritizing substances for E and A for proceeding into EDSP screening? For bypassing certain E or A EDSP receptor-mediated in vitro Tier 1 assays? For use in predicting results of the utero- trophic and Hershberger assays, obviating the need for these to be carried out in Tier 1 of the EDSP? Is there a set degree of scien- tific confidence in the performance of the assays and prediction models, irrespective of the type of regulatory use, or, as we sug- gested previously (Patlewicz et al., 2013), is it accepted that differ- ent uses can allow different levels of uncertainty/confidence, and, if so, what are these, in quantitative scientific terms? How can inte- gration of exposure data/estimates with such HTS activity-based measures/predictions (Wetmore et al., 2012; Becker et al., 2014) provide an improved context for priority setting and decision mak- ing? While such questions cannot be readily answered today, they warrant timely robust discussion within the regulatory science community. Clearly, with the caveat that the results to date reflect a limited number of substances, the ToxCast\u2122-derived E and A classification and cross validation models may have considerable utility to discriminate between substances that are a priority for proceeding into EDSP Tier 1 screening and those that are not. For use in EDSP, as well as for other potential applications, the Scien- tific Confidence Framework we have proposed, or a similar tool, can assist in the transparent characterization and communication of the performance of both assays and prediction models.

(2013), we discussed scientific confidence in the context of two validation frameworks, the IOM Framework (IOM, 2010) and the OECD Validation principles (2004), and adapted these for consideration in HTS/HCS assays. Similarly, Hartung et al. (2013) stated that \u2018\u2018validating the mecha- nism of a (group of) toxicant(s) is the basis for mechanistic valida- tion of tests that identify those toxicants,\u2019\u2019 and proposed that the performance of Tox21 test methods could be addressed through \u2018\u2018mechanistic validation\u2019\u2019 which focuses on biological pathways and is carried out in six steps: (1) articulation of the pathway (\u2018\u2018the biological/mechanistic circuitry (\u2018\u2018in the absence of xenobi- otic challenge\u2019\u2019) leading to the hazard; (2) documenting the evi- dence, based on results in validated models, that reference chemicals that cause the hazard \u2018\u2018perturb the biology in question;\u2019\u2019 (3) development of test(s) that reflect this biology; (4) verification that toxicants acting by this mechanism also do so in the test(s); (5) verification that antagonism or interference of the mechanism blocks or hinders positive test results. Although not a one-to-one match, this approach is, in essence, very similar to a well-informed adverse outcome pathway (AOP) that includes support for a causal link between the key event and adverse outcome (Ankley et al., 2010). While Judson et al. (2013) agree that increasing the use of well characterized reference compounds is important; they de- emphasize the need for cross-laboratory testing, stressing instead the importance of data availability to enable a \u2018\u2018web-based, trans- parent, and expedited peer review process.\u2019\u2019 Based on Patlewicz et al. (2013), the analysis reported here and our recent efforts in developing AOPs, we propose a Scientific Con- fidence Framework for prediction models derived from HTS assays (Table 5). This proposed framework contains three inter-related elements: Analytical Validation, Qualification and Utilization. Together, these three elements should facilitate systematic, transparent, and objective evaluation and documentation of the scientific confidence of HTS/HCS assays and their prediction mod- els. Addressing these elements may be challenging, although it is envisioned that the manner and extent to which these need to be addressed will be context dependent. To illustrate application of the proposed Scientific Confidence Framework, we considered the Rotroff et al. (2013) report and the case study presented above. With respect to the first framework element, Analytical Validation, each of the 18 endo- crine ToxCast\u2122 assays has a defined mechanistic endpoint. In terms of accessibility to ToxCast\u2122 data to enable independent verification, or refinement of existing prediction models or development of new models, EPA\u2019s ToxCast\u2122 program is to be commended. All of the data were accessible from the ToxCast\u2122 web site or from the Supplemental Materials in the Rotroff et al. (2013) publication. However, we did not review or analyze the chemical domains of applicability or documentation of assay per- formance characteristics (reliability, sensitivity, and specificity). Such a review is important, and requires a detailed and separate analysis outside the scope of this manuscript. In terms of the second framework element, Qualification (assessment of the prediction model derived from the HTS/HCS screening assays), the Rotroff et al. (2013) HTS-derived EDSP T1S endocrine prediction models fell well short. None of the published prediction model algorithms were transparent, nor were the algo- rithms clearly defined and documented. Input from the first author was helpful, but significant efforts were still needed to reverse engineer the prediction models. For the most part, the underlying data sets were available to support this reverse engineering activ- ity, however, the precise details of how dose\u2013response data were re-coded as binary and response indicators (using an unspecified Hill function with some manual adjustment) were not documented or readily available in the Supplementary Materials. Thus, considerable unnecessary effort was required to enable indepen- dent verification. In terms of documentation of measures of good- ness-of-fit, robustness and predictivity of the prediction models, Rotroff et al. (2013), provided estimates for predictivity of classifi- cation (fitting); but unbiased performance determinations (cross validation) for prediction of as-yet unknown EDSP outcomes from ToxCast\u2122 data were not provided. Our analysis suggests that focusing the assay set to those of known biological relevance may increase the predictive performance (although not necessarily the fitting performance). With respect to use of datasets in model development, the difference between results of guideline studies vs. non-guideline studies should be noted. Based on our experience, we would recommend that toxicity study databases assembled for use in constructing predictive modeling should be curated by experienced toxicologists, with a particular focus on defining study quality and data reliability using a predetermined set of criteria that allow for identification of positive versus nega- tive responses based on accepted toxicological principles. How- ever, the models still must be used with caution because the domain of applicability \u2013 the structural space of substances used to construct these classification and prediction models \u2013 is cur- rently limited to 21 chemicals for estrogen pathways and 14 for androgen pathways. Thus, research and development needs to con- tinue to develop data sets and prediction models, before prediction models derived from HTS/HCS results can be used as standalone algorithms to predict in vivo endocrine endpoints. Regarding the third element of the framework, Utilization, Rotroff et al. (2013) indicate the intent is to use these models to \u2018\u2018predict components of EDSP T1S and related results.\u2019\u2019 First, we agree with Rotroff et al. (2013), that current ToxCast results are inadequate to predict S and T responses. For E and A, our analysis shows that because these models were developed using fitting, they fall short in truly predicting EDSP Tier 1 E and A in vivo results. 450 Louis Anthony (Tony) Cox et al. / Regulatory Toxicology and Pharmacology 69 (2014) 443\u2013450 Nevertheless, the balanced accuracies of both the classification (fitting) and cross validation models for E and A activities signal significant advancement in developing biologically-based HTS/ HCS-derived models for E and A endocrine activities. Yet, with respect to regulatory use, a number of questions still must be addressed concerning the acceptable range of predictivity (balanced accuracy) of an E or A prediction model necessary to use for a given purpose. How accurate must predictivity be for prioritizing substances for E and A for proceeding into EDSP screening? For bypassing certain E or A EDSP receptor-mediated in vitro Tier 1 assays? For use in predicting results of the utero- trophic and Hershberger assays, obviating the need for these to be carried out in Tier 1 of the EDSP? Is there a set degree of scien- tific confidence in the performance of the assays and prediction models, irrespective of the type of regulatory use, or, as we sug- gested previously (Patlewicz et al., 2013), is it accepted that differ- ent uses can allow different levels of uncertainty/confidence, and, if so, what are these, in quantitative scientific terms? How can inte- gration of exposure data/estimates with such HTS activity-based measures/predictions (Wetmore et al., 2012; Becker et al., 2014) provide an improved context for priority setting and decision mak- ing? While such questions cannot be readily answered today, they warrant timely robust discussion within the regulatory science community. Clearly, with the caveat that the results to date reflect a limited number of substances, the ToxCast\u2122-derived E and A classification and cross validation models may have considerable utility to discriminate between substances that are a priority for proceeding into EDSP Tier 1 screening and those that are not. For use in EDSP, as well as for other potential applications, the Scien- tific Confidence Framework we have proposed, or a similar tool, can assist in the transparent characterization and communication of the performance of both assays and prediction models.

Calculated MOEs for aggregate cosmetic use scenarios in adults and children ranged from 27 to 220 for PhE and from 26 to 217 for PhAA. All of the calculated MOEs are above the PBPK-refined total UF for interspecies extrapolation of 25 (Table 10). The lowest MOE of 26 compared to the refined inter- species UF of 25 is equivalent to an MOE of 104 compared to the standard default interspecies UF of 100 used in the absence of Tk information to address toxicokinetic uncertainty. Importantly, these favorable MOEs are obtained even in the context of using conservative PBPK model assumptions as well as very exaggerated product composition and use assumptions.

The modeled differences account for differences in physiology and var- iation in metabolism and produced representations of both phar- macokinetic and pharmacodynamic outcomes from the current range of oral exposures. The linked model structure preserved the predictive ability of the PBPK/PD model.

Finally, technical com- ments from staff of the Toxicology Division of the TCEQ and agency support at all levels significantly contributed to the development of a carcinogenic assessment of high scientific quality. 3.2 Dose metric 3.3 Dose\u2013response assessment: slope parameter (\u03b2 3.3.1 Poisson regression modeling \u2013 Crump et al.

Uncertainty factors are used to address lack of knowledge regarding the relative sensitivity of a chemical in humans versus animals; there is information on nPB that negates this uncertainty. Acceptable OELs based on this and other studies evaluating the entire nPB data base range from 90 to 214ppm, incorporating UFs of 1 or 2. The recom- mended OEL for nPB from this study is 156ppm, which is near the midpoint of this range.

We propose that an upper-bound CSF for Aroclor 1268 of 0.27 (mg/kg-day)\ufffd1 is reasonable based on the avail- able data. Although this CSF would represent about a 7- to 8-fold reduction relative to USEPA\u2019s default value, it is still believed to be a conservative estimate based on the animal data. It not only equals the highest upper- bound estimate calculated for male rats (see Table 9), but also equals the highest upper-bound estimate cal- culated for females assuming that Ah-receptor-depen- dent and independent cancer mechanisms co-exist (see Table 8).

Wang et al. / Regulatory Toxicology and Pharmacology 59 (2011) 215\u2013226 225 the number of descriptors were pared down to approximately half the number of chemicals in a dataset by eliminating descriptors with high collinearity prior to the development of QSAR models, there are some limitations in the statistical approaches that were used for developing models by screening a large number of chem- ical descriptors (relative to the number of chemicals in a dataset) in the literature (Benigni and Bossa, 2008; Kubinyi, 2005; Topliss and Edwards, 1979). The probability for chance correlation of these developed models could be high (Topliss and Edwards, 1979). Fur- thermore, there is growing evidence that the various statistical ap- proaches (including the ones in this paper) may not be appropriate at evaluating the true external predictivity for large range of exter- nal chemicals (Benigni and Bossa, 2008; Kubinyi, 2005). It may be necessary to test out several different statistical approaches for QSAR model development, In addition, it is extremely important to perform true external validation for each model both numeri- cally (experimental vs. predicted) and statistically (external r2 and q2) using a sufficiently large number of test chemicals. Users should keep in mind the intrinsic limitations with any computa- tional or statistical models and should rely more on the potential biological basis (e.g., mode of action) for estimating cancer potency for a chemical of interest without any experimental data. Although the current QSAR models show promise for predictions, they are not ready for regulatory decision; however, they could serve as a starting point for evaluating and/or prioritizing chemicals of interest.

This provides the pharmacokinetic ratio- nale for clinical studies to test this combination therapy to the patient with hypertension and type-2 diabetes mellitus. Positive pharmacodynamic interaction between pioglitazone and olmesar- tan medoxomil was established resulting in enhanced antidiabetic potential of pioglitazone in combination with olmesartan medoxo- mil as compared to the pioglitazone alone. Significant reduction in body weight antagonizing efficiency of combination of pioglitaz- one and olmesartan medoxomil was much more than that of indi- vidual drugs because of its greater efficiency in lowering blood glucose level than that of pioglitazone alone. There were no signif- icant changes in hematology, serum biochemistry and organ weight observed in repeated dose 28-day oral toxicity study of pioglitazone-olmesartan medoxomil combination in Wistar albino rat. No detectable abnormalities were found in the histopathology of the selected organs. These preliminary toxicological results sug- gest that short-term treatment of rat with this combination is de- void of any harmful effects. It can be concluded from findings of the present study that pioglitazone-olmesartan medoxomil is effective and safe and offers no obvious toxicity thus can be evolve as prom- ising regimen for treatment of diabetic antihypertensive patient. Long-term toxicity studies are needed in order to rule out any long-term adverse effect of the combination. 6.
