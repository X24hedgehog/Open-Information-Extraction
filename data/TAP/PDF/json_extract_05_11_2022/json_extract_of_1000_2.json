A larger number of miRNAs were detected and their expression levels were higher in smokers than in non- smokers. Becausemore thanhalf of themiRNAswere reported to be po- tential biomarkers of diseases, we suggest the possibility that smoking statusmight complicate diagnosis. The plasmamiRNA profiles thatmir- ror changes in miRNA expression in tissues might signal smoking- related diseases. The information presented here provides new insight into an area of future research on circulating miRNAs. Conflict of interest statement The authors declare that there are no conflicts of interest.

Therefore, the possible role of accumulating gangliosides or glycolipids as apoptosis inducers should be examined (Huang et al., 1997). At present, one can only speculate that drug accumulation and secondary mixed lipidosis in lysosomes would provoke lysosomal membrane rupture, which could result in the release of cysteine proteases activating caspase-3 (Ishisaka et al., 1998, 2001), a key effector in the execution phase of apoptosis (Enari et al., 1998). This intriguing possibility deserves further investigations. Acknowledgments We are grateful to J.P. Basile, T. Lac, M. Leruth, F. Discussion Acknowledgements References"}},

These observations may therefore allow development of understand- ing for the mechanism of potentially life-threatening dysglycemia during fluoroquinolone therapy.

Impor- tantly, this is the first study to investigate genome-wide responses in human, mouse and rat primary B cells treated with TCDD. Collectively, time-course comparison of mouse, human and rat genomic responses presented in this study suggest that despite the evolutionary conserva- tion of the AhR and its signaling pathway (Hahn, 2002), there are signif- icant differences in TCDD-regulated molecular mechanisms between species that disrupt early signaling during B cell activation and differen- tiation and ultimately lead to the suppression of the IgM response. Fur- ther studies will be needed to confirm the specific roles of deregulated genes andmolecularmechanisms responsible for impaired B cell activa- tion and plasmacytoid differentiation.

In contrast, Fe2O3-30 nmparticles were easily able to pass across the intestinal bar- rier and the NMs mainly accumulated in the liver, spleen, kidney, heart and bone marrow. The excretion data showed that small amount of NMs was cleared via urine, whilst most of NMs were excreted via feces. The incorporation of Fe in the various tissues was in the range of 0.2-9.4% in the Fe2O3-30 nm treated groups and it was 0.01-2.3% in the Fe2O3-bulk treated groups. The accumulation depended on the doses and time intervals. The biodistribution and clearance profile of NMs showed concurrently composite events, and the dynamics of Fe concentration in different tissues, urine and feces changed with time. Hence, it can be concluded, that orally administered NMs were easily metabolized and regulated by the body\u2019s usual physiological homeo- static mechanism. The bioavailabe Fe from exposure of Fe2O3-30 nm and Fe2O3-bulk particles in rats was biocompatible and inactive in gen- erating ROS and did not cause significant DNA damage, MN-PCEs and CAs. Fe2O3-30 nm NMs were well tolerated by rats after absorption through intestinal tract. This indicates that the accumulated Fe did not lead to significant genotoxicological effects. The present data adds to the information of Fe2O3 NMs in order to be able to interpret its toxico- logical implication. However more studies are warranted for careful as- sessment to ensure safety of Fe2O3 NMs in biomedical applications. Hence we need to investigate sub acute and chronic study.

We systematically isolated a large number of genes that significantly regulated by RXR and RAR ligands. The characteristics of up-regulated and down-regulated genes are most different. Our data suggest that not only the well-known RXR- RAR heterodimer is the functional units of RA treatment, but PPAR and adipocytokine signaling pathways are key to the control of metabolism with retinoid treatment in X. tropicalis embryos. The clustering results revealed that phenotypic and global gene expression changes induced by 9c-RA separated from those by at-RA and FBA, indicating different bi- ological effects of the separate compounds. Microarray analysis exhibits better clustering results than phenotypic analysis in high concentration groups. Conflict of interest statement None of the authors have competing interests.

Increasing the acet- ylthiocholine concentration from 0.01375 mM to 0.0275 mM appeared to increase the binding affinity of chlorpyrifos oxon (as evidenced by a decreased Kd) yet reduce the oxon's capacity to phosphorylate Ser-203 (as evidenced by a reduced k2) (Fig. 8). The net effect of these alterations was to increase ki, the inhibitory capacity, by about 59% (Fig. 8). Other peripheral site ligands such as propidium, gallamine and D-tubocurarine have been previously reported to accelerate the inhibition of recombinant mouse acetylcholinesterase by paraoxon and other neutral organophosphates (Radi\u0107 and Taylor, 1999; Radi\u0107 and Taylor, 2001). Radi\u0107 and Taylor (2001) concluded that ligands binding to the peripheral anionic site altered the conformation of those amino acids lining the choline binding site, thereby providing a more efficient fit of the leaving groups of uncharged organophosphates. Since acetylthiocholine (as well as acetylcholine) is also a peripheral site ligand, one can reasonably conclude a similar action towards chlorpyrifos oxon in the current study, particularly in view of the observed reduc- tion in Kd brought by acetylthiocholine (Fig. 8). Additionally, the current report demonstrated an effect on k2 also resulting from acetylthiocholine (Fig. 8). However, it must be remem- bered that the actions of acetylthiocholine documented in Fig. 8 are occurring in the presence of 100 nM chlorpyrifos oxon, which by itself caused a striking reduction in its own ki (Fig. 4). It should be noted that physiological concentrations of acetylcholine, although highly variable, have been reported to reach the millimolar range in narrow synaptic clefts following evoked release (Van Der Kloot and Molg\u00f3 (1994). Conse- quently, transient occupation of the peripheral anionic site by acetylcholine in vivo likely occurs. Although the details of the interactions of these oxons with acetylcholinesterase other than the phosphorylation of Ser-203 are not known with certainty at the present time, the non- Michaelis\u2013Menten kinetics documented in the current report and elsewhere (Kardos and Sultatos, 2000; Kousba et al., 2004; Rosenfeld and Sultatos, 2006) could have possible implications for the risk assessment of chlorpyrifos and related insecticides. When addressing this issue, however, the relationship between oxon levels that might exist in vivo following exposure to insecticides versus the oxon concentrations that are associated with a changing ki in vitro should be considered. Due to the enormous difficulties in quantification of oxon levels in vivo following exposure to organophosphorus insecticides, only one study has systematically provided adequate pharmacokinetic information describing the blood levels of parent insecticide (chlorpyrifos) and corresponding oxon (chlorpyrifos oxon). Timchalk et al. (2002), utilizing GC-Mass Spec to measure chlorpyrifos oxon concentrations in the rat following oral administration of chlorpyrifos, found that 10 mg/kg chlorpy- rifos produced very slight inhibition of brain acetylcholinester- ase, with corresponding blood oxon levels of 2\u20137 nM. Consequently, at least in the rat, dose\u2013response curves generated with measurable brain acetylcholinesterase inhibition represent inhibition occurring at chlorpyrifos oxon blood levels higher than 2\u20137 nM. As shown in Fig. 4, with human recombinant acetylcholinesterase the chlorpyrifos oxon ki is markedly reduced at oxon concentrations higher than about 10 nM. Therefore, extrapolation of such a dose\u2013response curve to low insecticide levels could result in an underestimation of insecticide risk because the capacity of individual chlorpyrifos oxon molecules to inhibit acetylcholinesterase at very low oxon levels could be greater than those individual oxon molecules in vivo associated with the dose\u2013response curve. Thus, concentration-dependent interactions of certain oxons with acetylcholinesterase might contribute, along with toxico- kinetic factors and factors linking acetylcholinesterase inhibi- tion with cholinergic dysfunction, to non-linear dose\u2013response relationships.

Conclusions This study in rhesus monkeys extends the information about maternal/fetal pharmacokinetics for BPA beyond previous work with pregnant and fetal rats. The additional information from concurrent pharmacokinetic measurements in maternal and fetal compartments following bolus IV administration to the dam permitted critical evalua- tion of the impact of maternal, placental, and fetal metabolism and dis- position on exposures to the fetus of the pharmacologically active aglycone form of BPA. Amajor impact of Phase II metabolism in thema- ternal GI tract, liver, and placenta, and in the fetus as well, on attenuat- ing fetal exposures to aglycone BPAwas observed. These results should empower a more critical evaluation of results from human fluids and tissue biomonitoring studies that report maternal and fetal exposures to BPA. The continuing goal of this pharmacokinetic data collection pro- cess is to develop PBPKmodels that focus on perinatal and adult periods in relevant experimental animal models in conjunction with validated human biomonitoring and pharmacokinetic measurements (Fisher et al., 2011). The ultimate aim is to reduce the uncertainty in risk assess- ments based on predicted levels of the active form of BPA in any plausible target tissue of human fetuses, infants, and adults for exposures through food, medical devices, and other environmental sources.", "Acknowledgement": "Acknowledgments This research was supported in part by an Interagency Agreement (FDA 224-07-0007; NIH Y1ES1027) between NCTR/FDA and the Na- tional Institute of Environmental Health Sciences/National Toxicology Program.

When assessing the potential for a chemical to cause harm to humans one must remember to examine the entire pathology database in context of the study design, the mode of action of the chemical of concern, and to use the most current interpretation of a lesion to decide on the significance to human health of a particular tissue response.

In the present study, we observed that cordycepin resulted in autophagic and apoptotic cell death irrespective of the ER response. Transiently transfected MCF-7 cells with ER\u03b1-targeted siRNA showed no significant decrease in LC3-II compared with a con- trol nonspecific siRNA-transfected cells after exposure to 200 \u03bcM cor- dycepin. The autophagosome was also identified by with AVO and MDC staining even in ER\u03b1 down-regulated MCF-7 cells after exposure to cordycepin. Understanding the role of the ER in cell death path- ways of breast cancer cells is important because the ER mediates the tumor promoting effects of estrogens (Paruthiyil et al., 2004). However, developing therapeutic agents stimulating cell death through selective ER subtypes are elusive because most breast tumors coexpress both ER\u03b1 and ER\u03b2 (Fuqua et al., 2003; Speirs et al., 1999). Some therapeutic agents selective for ER\u03b1 such as tamoxifen are largely ineffective against ER-negative breast cancer cells. Several studies also indicate that ER\u03b2 expression in human breast tumors is associated with a poorer prognosis compared with tumors that only express ER\u03b1 (Katzenellenbogen et al., 2005). Moreover, the clinical utility of ER antagonists is often limited by side effects (Nilsson et al., 2001). Thus, novel agents such as cordycepin that are relatively safe but can suppress growth of both ER-positive and ER-negative human breast cancers is highly desirable. In conclusion, we have documented that cordycepin treatment effectively triggers apoptotic and autophagic cell death in human breast cancer cells and that cor- dycepin-mediated cell death pathways is not ER-dependent. These data provide a basic mechanism for the chemopreventive properties of cordycepin in future therapeutic applications.

Nickel induces the in- flammatory responses via a TLR-4/NF-\u03baB pathway, whereas zinc causes the inflammatory responses via a broader regulation, i.e., TLR-dependent and TLR-independent signaling pathways. I\u03baB\u03b1 phosphorylation/NF-\u03baB activation is the primary mechanism involved in the zinc/nickel-induced inflammatory responses. These studies provide new insight for under- standing the mechanisms of those inflammatory diseases induced by the proinflammatory metals.

However, a recent large US study showed an association between U-Cd and myocardial infarction (Everett and Frithsen, 2008). Furthermore, in environmentally exposed subjects in Belgium, urinary cadmium excretion was associated with changes in some physiological indicators of cardiovascular function, i.e. pulse wave velocity, arterial pulse pressures, and arterial compliance and distensibility (Schutte et al., 2008b). The pathogenesis of these cadmium-associated abnormalities is unclear at present. As noted above, cadmiummay potentiate diabetes-induced effects on kidney (\u00c5kesson et al., 2005; Buchet et al., 1990; Chen et al., 2006). A recent large cross-sectional study using US NHANES data showed that urinary cadmium levels are significantly and dose-dependently associated with both impaired fasting glucose and diabetes, suggest- ing that cadmiummay be a cause of prediabetes and diabetes mellitus in humans (Schwartz et al., 2003). Renal damage could cause cadmium to leak into urine, potentially leading to a (noncausal) association between cadmium and diabetes. The investigators there- fore restricted the analysis to persons without laboratory evidence of renal damage, but this restriction did not appreciably affect their findings. There were clear dose\u2013response relationships between U-Cd and fasting glucose as well as diabetes with an OR=2.05 (95% CI: 1.42\u20132.95) for fasting glucose at U-Cd levels of 2 \u03bcg/g creatinine or above. However, the pathogenesis remains to be explored."}},

This supports the selection of the EROD assay over the QPCR assay for relating changes in CYP1A gene expression to overt toxicity of PCBs. The results presented herein support those obtained from the LRG assay (Manning et al., 2012) and indicate that AHR1-mediated in- duction of enzyme activity is strongly associated with PCB-induced embryolethality in several species of birds. To overcomeproblems asso- ciated with the limited sensitivity of the LRG assay that arise when test- ing the effects of weak AHR agonists, the EROD and LRG assays can be used in a complementary fashion to reduce the number of animals re- quired for predicting DLC toxicity.

Both types of Ag NPs induced p53 protein expression, DNA double strand breakage and apoptosis responses in mES and MEF cells. Based on the expression levels of p53, Rad51, phospho-H2AX and annexin V proteins, and MTT assay coated Ag NPs exhibited more severe damage than uncoated Ag NPs. The results suggest the different surface chemistry of Ag NPs have different effects on genotoxicity. This short-exposure study of high- level elicitation of genotoxicity by Ag NPs will need to be further investigated to determine if long-term or low-level exposure consequences may exist for Ag NPs applications.

We observed that not all injured oocytes are eliminated, since foci are still present 8 days after exposures and \u03b3H2AX is thought to remain at DSBs until repair is fully accomplished (Redon et al., 2002). Exposure-induced follicle loss has been reported for other genotoxic drugs, radiation, cigarette smoke, and pollutants (Hoyer and Sipes, 1996; Chemaitilly et al., 2006; Sonmezer and Oktay, 2006) and some of these have been shown to induce DNA damage in other models. Thus, DSB formation in oocytes may be a common mechanism of ovotoxicants. Furthermore, results raise concern for the use of GnRH antagonists and other agents in preserving fertility in chemotherapy patients (Somers et al., 2005; Blumenfeld, 2007; Hudson, 2010). Such techniques may conserve both healthy and unhealthy gametes, something that should be monitored as standards of care change. Also, both primordial follicle loss and DNA damage can be cumulative if damage is not repaired, so even low-level, daily environmental exposures could lead to earlier ovarian failure (as exemplified by smoking (Jick et al., 1977)) or compromised gametes. The latter has the potential to be a mechanism through which some embryo/fetal losses ormalformations occur. Futureworkwill examine other chemicals that may induce DNA damage in oocytes. More sensitivemodels to detect DNA damagewould be required to examine the long-term fate of injured gametes in vivo.

Thus, use of SYBR Green dye for detection of real-time PCR products offers a simple, sensitive, specific, inexpensive, and rapid method for routine quantification of gene transcripts of toxicological interest.

Timchalk et al. / Toxicology and Applied Pharmacology 219 (2007) 217\u2013225 saliva ideally suited as a non-invasive approach and should result in excellent compliance, which is of critical importance for meaningful interpretation of biomonitoring data. However, to enable utilization of saliva for chemical biomonitoring requires the utilization of very sensitive and specific analytical methods for quantitation and the relationship between chemical concentration in blood and saliva must be established (Timchalk et al., 2004). As previously reported by Liu et al. (2005) and highlighted in this manuscript, a sequential injection electro- chemical immunoassay has been developed for the quantitation of TCP, and has a reported detection limit for TCP of 6 ng/L in water. Using the PBPK model to simulate a theoretical blood and saliva TCP concentration resulting from CPF exposure at the ADI or RfD dose levels, suggests that the electrochemical immunoassay could quantify TCP in both blood and saliva specimens. Although this is encouraging, it will be critically important to evaluate the detection limits for TCP in biological fluids. For example, in developing a microanalytical system for the detection of lead (Pb) in blood or saliva, protein in the sample produced some electrode fouling resulting in a reduced responsiveness and irreproducible quantitation (Yantasee et al., 2005). However, optimization of sample pretreatment has resulted in excellent reproducibility and reliability of the sensor using biological fluids. For saliva to be a useful quantitative biomonitoring matrix for assessing CPF exposure, it is imperative to understand the pharmacokinetic relationship between saliva concentration of TCP and CPF dose. To this end, PBPK modeling has been useful as a quantitative tool (Andersen, 1995). With regard to CPF, a PBPK/PD model has been previously developed and included a compartmental model to handle the formation and excretion of TCP in urine (Timchalk et al., 2002). To facilitate modeling of saliva TCP, the TCP compartmental sub-model within the CPF PBPK/PD model has been modified to accommodate saliva excretion. It is important to recognize that this model was developed with a limited data set; nonetheless the capability of the model to predict blood and saliva TCP concentration following CPF exposure is encoura- ging. Ongoing efforts are focused at including a saliva compartment within the pharmacodynamic model to enable simulation of salivary ChE inhibition kinetics.", "Acknowledgement": "Acknowledgments This publication was partially supported by grants R01 OH008173-01 and R01 OH003629-03 from Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and partially by the US Environmental Protection Agency's STAR program through grant R828608.

Scheme summarizing the effects elicited by KG-501 on hiPSC-derived neuronal cul- tures. Upon inhibition of CREB signaling using KG-501, hiPSC-neurons activate pro- survival and/or stress-related responses, characterized by the immediate upregulation of NR4A2 gene and the downregulation of the vesicular neurotransmitter transporter- related gene SLC18A1 gene expression, occurringwithin 3 h, together with an impairment of neurite length and neurite complexity. A transient activation of CREB and upregulation of FOS geneoccurwithin 1 day of KG-501 exposure (early effects). Furthermore, a progres- sive loss of neuronal functionality is observed, as shown by the sustained decrease of SLC18A1 gene, the time dependent downregulation of both BDNF-AS1 and SYP expression and the decrease of neurites and of MAP2+ cells, occurring already after 3 days of KG-501 exposure (intermediate effects). After 7 days, KG-501 exposure elicits MAPT gene down- regulation and overall reduction of cell viability (late effects).

As with in vivo experiments, the cell cycle effects of TCDD exposure were shown to be the most dramatic in the DN3/ DN4 stage of thymocyte differentiation in vitro. We used a lympho- cyte differentiation assay combined with extreme limiting dilution analysis (Hu and Smyth, 2009) to follow prenatally-exposed LSK cells from the progenitor stage through to lymphocyte commit- ment, arriving at a numerical differentiation potential. The in vitro co-culture assay allowed us to focus on TCDD's effect on only the LSK cells, without any potential cross-signaling from TCDD- exposed supporting tissues. Additionally, the single cell sorting procedure enabled us to examine one LSK cell at a time to deter- mine its ability to differentiate into a lymphocyte. Utilization of an in vitro co-culture system to test the effects of developmental toxicological exposures on hematopoietic stem cells is not only novel, but also preferable to some types of in vivo studies due to the fast concise measures of immunological impact. Our approach to determining lymphocyte differentiation potential could be mod- ified to test the developmental immunotoxicological effects of other compounds. Finally, this approach could facilitate analysis of the sensitivity of other tissue-specific stem and progenitor cells to developmental exposures.

Considering the prominent developmental expression of the Nav1.3 and \u03b2- 3 subunits, these data support the hypothesis that pharmacodynamic differences may contribute to age-dependent differences for Type II pyrethroids. Additional experiments are required to demonstrate more conclusively whether or not such pharmacodynamic differences exist. For example, comparisons of pyrethroid sensitivity between mammalian neurons freshly dissociated from fetal or neonatal vs adult CNS tissue might provide additional evidence to support or reject this hypothesis. Ultimately, risk decisions regarding pyrethroid neurotoxicity under the Food Quality Protection Act will be best informed by understanding both pharmacokinetic and pharmacody- namic differences between infants or neonatal and adult animals.

PAR-2 is activated in two different ways; either bleomycin increases ROS level that leads to activation of PAR-2 to promote PF, or ROS generation directly activates the ECM proteins, MMPs 2/9, cytokines and collagen accumulation, which leads to PF directly or indirectly by mediating their effects through PAR 2. DAS is very effective in preventing PF, and the mechanism of lung protection is attributable to its inhibitory effect on PAR-2 signaling via downregulating ROS and other profibrotic mole- cules (Fig. 9).

Bleomycin-induces the production of ROS, which in turn stimulates inflammation ion for PAR-2 activation, which leads to the development of PF. The progression of PF by of PAR-2 activation involves the upregulation of ROS when we administered bleomycin he profibrotic molecules such as MMP-2 and -9, HSP-47 and \u03b1-SMA, which results in in PF.

Additionally, it has been shown that there is a species difference between mice and rats in the pathway(s) by which VCD causes follicle loss. Many strains and species are known to have dramatic differences in their sensitivity to AhR ligands (Denison and Heath-Pagliuso, 1998). Therefore, the AhR may be a more important component of VCD-induced follicle loss in rats, as compared with mice. Consequently, it is likely that acceleration of atresia by VCD in mice in small pre-antral follicles occurs by (an) AhR-independent intracellular pathway(s). Understanding species differences in general mechanisms of toxicant-induced follicle loss as well as cell signaling in normal ovarian atresia can provide insight into factors that regulate the reproductive life span in women.

The differ- ences in the behavioral effect dose\u2013response profiles correlated signifi- cantly with differences in various structural and physical properties of the compounds. Although fully elucidating the mechanisms underlying the behavioral effects of C2ClHs must await further research, the results of the present study suggest that differences in specific structural and physical properties of C2ClHs produce differences in behavioral effects that lead to wide variation in dose\u2013response profiles.

It is possible in fact to modify the synthesis procedure in order to insert in the crystal structure other components, including iron and other metal ions (Foresti et al., in press). We are presently planning further experiments, using synthetic chrysotile fibers con- taining different and strictly controlled amounts of metal ions, to determine more accurately the contribution of contaminants in the biological effects of asbestos. However, the stoichiometric synthetic chrysotile may be proposed as a useful reference (negative control) in studies aimed to investigate the molecular mechanisms of asbestos toxicity.

Single dose treatment with DZP antagonized convulsive behaviors, but did not prevent brain ictal EEG activity or lethality caused by TMDT. Conversely, NMDA receptor antagonists, while not blocking the full spectrum of TMDT convulsant activity, did effectively inhibit tonic\u2013clonic motor seizures, and may increase long-term survival. Fur- ther research is needed to determine longer-term (>24 h) effects of TMDT upon behavior and EEG, combinedwith assessment of treatment regimens that address both the quality and persistence of TMDT seizures and eventual lethality. NMDA receptor antagonists, used alone or in combination with GABAA positive modulators, deserve fur- ther investigation and may have a role to play in the treatment of TMDT-induced seizures.

We found that all mice exposed to ozone had decreased Cdyn as compared with the groups exposed to air, a finding that is consistent with the development of alveolar edema in these animals. There was no measurable difference in lung compliance between the NOS2\u2212/\u2212 and C57BL/6 strains after exposure, despite the differences in their inflammatory cell response as demonstrated in Figs. 2 and 3. Higher numbers of neutrophils in the lung lavage do not directly correlate, therefore, with a measurable decline in lung compliance. The two strains of chimeric mice we studied showed lung lavage data fully consistent with the bone marrow donor strain (Fig. 6) and lung compliance that also decreased in response to ozone exposure with no significant differences between the mouse strains. In summary, experiments with chimeric NOS2 mice have shown that NO is generated primarily from the bone-marrow- derived inflammatory cells after exposure to ozone. NOS2 is not the sole enzyme responsible for the production of NO during such an exposure, and in fact we find up-regulation of NOS3 in the NOS2\u2212/\u2212 mice exposed to ozone, perhaps as a compen- satory mechanism. Mice that produce significant amounts of NO from both the inflammatory cells and host airway epithelial cells are partially protected from the lung injury that results from exposure to ozone. Acute exposure to ozone also causes systemic oxidant stress, manifested here as increased oxidation of R-SH groups in blood plasma proteins. The molecular species involved include nitrogenous compounds or radicals, based on the increased susceptibility of NOS2\u2212/\u2212 mice and of chimeric animals with their leukocytes derived from NOS2\u2212/\u2212 mice. Therefore, NO produced from NOS2 appears to play a protective role in the lung inflammatory responses associated with ozone exposure in mice, as revealed by the responses of the chimeric mouse strains constructed for the present study.

This could be due to an effect of cigarette smoke to increase myocardial oxygen demand (increased heart rate and blood pressure), and/or to decrease oxygen supply (increased risk of coronary thrombosis, coronary vasoconstriction, and increased carboxyhemoglobin, Zhu et al., 1994). Decreased capacity of myocytes for ATP production by oxidative phosphorylation may also be a factor (Gvozdjakova et al., 1992). Cigarette smoke could also increase the size of an infarction produced by coronary artery occlusion, which would be expected to increase mortality. This hypothesis was tested by Zhu et al. (1994) in rats exposed to environmental cigarette smoke for up to 6 weeks, and then subjected to 35 min of left coronary artery occlusion, followed by 2 h of reperfusion. They found that exposure for 3 days (plasma [nicotine] 20 ng/ml) caused a slight but insignificant increase in infarct size (area of infarct/area at risk). Exposure for 3 weeks ([nicotine] 50 ng/ml) and 6 weeks ([nicotine] 60 ng/ml caused a highly significant increase in infarct size (control 34%, 6 weeks 61%. Some or all of the factors mentioned above could contribute to the increase in rat heart infarct size observed in the study of Zhu et al. (1994). However, our findings provide an additional mechanism: a CSE-induced increase in the susceptibility to the MPT, shown in our experiments in mouse ventricular myocytes which are similar to rat myocytes (Su et al., 1999, 2003). The MPT is thought to contribute to irreversible injury caused by ischemia/reperfusion, and is proposed to result from opening of a pore in the inner mitochondrial membrane, consisting in part of the voltage dependent anion channel (VDAC), the adenine nucleotide translocator, and cyclophilin (Baines et al., 2005). Initiation of the MPT is thought to result from increased Ca2+ loading and increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) inmitochondria (Weiss et al., 2003; Brookes et al., 2004), and results in release of mitochondrial Ca2+ and cytochrome C, as well as dissipation of the mitochondrial membrane potential, with increased consumption and decreased production of ATP. These events can cause necrotic and apoptotic myocyte death (Korge et al., 2001; Nakagawa et al., 2005). As shown in Fig. 2, 0.1% CSE increased susceptibility to induction of the MPT induced by argon laser illumination, in mouse myocytes loaded with the fluorescent probe TMRM. This effect could be prevented by the superoxide scavenger Tiron. This suggested that ROS in the CSE were contributing to the effect, although it is theoretically possible that CSE also contains substances that induce generation of ROS within the cell. Tiron had no effect on the susceptibility to induction of the MPT in the absence of CSE. This was an unexpected finding, as previous investigators have shown that different ROS scavengers can delay the MPT in this model (Duchen, 2000; Huser et al., 1998). This may be due to limited access of Tiron to the intra-mitochondrial space where ROS are generated during laser illumination, and to our specific experimental conditions of TMRM loading and laser illumination intensity. However, CSE also increased Ca2+ uptake by mitochondria (Fig. 3), and this effect was clearly inhibited by Tiron, consistent with previous studies showing enhanced Ca2+ uptake by mitochondria during oxidative stress (Duchen, 2000). Thus CSE appears to increase susceptibility to the MPT by a ROS-dependent mechanism which causes increased mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake. This may result from an effect of ROS on the mitochondrial Ca2+ uniporter, which is the principal Ca2+ uptake pathway via which mitochondrial uptake buffers cytosolic Ca2+ (Seguchi et al., 2005). This idea is completely consistent with previous findings in our laboratory indicating that knock-out of the small heat shock proteins CRYAB and HSPB2, which increases injury produced by ischemia/reperfusion, increases mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake and susceptibility to the MPT (Kadono et al., 2006). As these direct effects of CSE on mitochondria are seen at concentrations (0.1% CSE, nicotine 15 ng/ml) lower than present in rats after prolonged exposure to cigarette smoke (nicotine 40\u201360 ng/ml), our observations could account at least in part for the findings of Zhu et al. (1994 and 1997). Our results also suggest that in humans during and after smoking (nicotine 7\u201335 ng/ml) an increase in infarct size caused by coronary occlusion and reperfusion could be anticipated. These findings therefore are potentially of considerable clinical significance. Possible mechanism of effects of CSE on angina threshold Thirty years ago, Aronow (1978) reported that passive smoking exacerbated exercise-induced angina in patients with coronary artery disease. He studied 10 men with stable angina, and performed exercise stress tests on a bicycle ergometer on 3 consecutive mornings. He measured the heart rate and blood pressure, and monitored the EKG. The exercise was performed after no exposure to smoking, after exposure to smoking in a ventilated room, and after exposure to smoking in an un-ventilated room. The duration of exercise required to produce angina (and ST segment depression) was decreased by 22 and 38% after exposure to smoking in a ventilated and non-ventilated room, respectively. The double product (HR\u00d7systolic BP) at which angina occurred was reduced in patients exposed to passive smoking, whereas the magnitude of ST segment depression at onset of angina was unchanged, suggesting that the reduced angina threshold caused by exposure to cigarette smoke was due to impaired myocardial oxygen delivery rather than an increased oxygen demand. Carboxyhemoglobin levels were increased by exposure to cigarette smoke, and Aronow (1978) proposed that this could be a mechanism causing decreased myocardial oxygen supply, but also suggested that ROS in cigarette smoke could possibly interfere with myocardial oxygen delivery. Based on our results, we believe Aronow's suggestion was correct. We have recently described an isolated rabbit myocyte model of demand ischemia, with which we have studied the mechanism of the anti-angina effects of ranolazine (Zhang et al., 2008). Rabbit myocytes are superior to rat or mouse myocytes for studies of the mechanism of effects of interventions on angina as rabbit myocytes more closely resemble human myocytes with respect to their electrophysiologic and calcium homeostatic characteristics (Su et al., 1999, 2003). We found that oxidative stress occurs during simulated demand ischemia, and appears to activate the late Na+ current, causing increased Na+ loading. This results in increased Ca2+ influx via Na+/Ca2+ exchange, and the resulting increase in [Ca2+]i causes myocardial contracture. The contracture is proposed to compress the coronary microvascu- lature resulting in subendocardial ischemia and angina. Ranolazine, by inhibiting the late Na+ current, prevents the contracture and improves subendocardial blood flow, thus reducing angina. As shown in Fig. 4, 0.1% CSE has the opposite effect in this model: it increases Ca2+ loading during simulated demand ischemia. This effect of CSE is prevented by the ROS scavenger Tiron, suggesting that ROS components in CSE are responsible. Since ranolazine decreases angina by decreasing Na+ and Ca2+ loading during simulated ischemia, it follows that CSE could increase angina by increasing Ca2+ loading. The fact that no effect of CSE on [Ca2+]i is observed in the presence of ranolazine (Fig. 5) indicates that the effect of CSE on Ca2+ loading is mediated by an effect 77S. Yamada et al. / Toxicology and Applied Pharmacology 236 (2009) 71\u201377 of CSE on the late Na+ current. These findings suggest that ranolazine might be particularly effective in controlling angina in patients who are exposed to cigarette smoke. Our findings are consistent with the idea that the detrimental effect of exposure to cigarette smoke on the angina threshold in patients with coronary artery disease is due in part to an increase in the late Na+ current during ischemia induced by ROS within cigarette smoke, with a resulting increase in Ca2+ influx via NCX. Furthermore, the fact that clinically relevant concentrations of CSE can increase [Ca2+]i during simulated ischemia in isolatedmyocytes indicates another mechanism by which CSE could increase the susceptibility to the MPT during ischemia: increased [Ca2+]i could further enhance mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake, and thus exacerbate mitochondrial Ca2+ loading. Thus, CSE has direct toxic effects on ventricular myocytes at clinically relevant concentrations. These effects appear to be due at least in part to ROS components of CSE, which act to increase cytosolic and mitochondrial Ca2+ loading. Conflict of interest William H.

Carboxyhemoglobin levels were increased by exposure to cigarette smoke, and Aronow (1978) proposed that this could be a mechanism causing decreased myocardial oxygen supply, but also suggested that ROS in cigarette smoke could possibly interfere with myocardial oxygen delivery. Based on our results, we believe Aronow's suggestion was correct.

These findings suggest that ranolazine might be particularly effective in controlling angina in patients who are exposed to cigarette smoke. Our findings are consistent with the idea that the detrimental effect of exposure to cigarette smoke on the angina threshold in patients with coronary artery disease is due in part to an increase in the late Na+ current during ischemia induced by ROS within cigarette smoke, with a resulting increase in Ca2+ influx via NCX. Furthermore, the fact that clinically relevant concentrations of CSE can increase [Ca2+]i during simulated ischemia in isolatedmyocytes indicates another mechanism by which CSE could increase the susceptibility to the MPT during ischemia: increased [Ca2+]i could further enhance mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake, and thus exacerbate mitochondrial Ca2+ loading. Thus, CSE has direct toxic effects on ventricular myocytes at clinically relevant concentrations. These effects appear to be due at least in part to ROS components of CSE, which act to increase cytosolic and mitochondrial Ca2+ loading. Conflict of interest William H.

Although not well reported by inhalation studies a similar translocation via the trigeminus has to be assumed. In contrast, 192IrNP on the alveolar epi- thelium need (a) to be endocytosed by epithelial type I and/or type II cells, (b) exocytosed into the interstitial alveolar space and at least onemore endo- and exocytosis step by endothelial vascular cells before they reach blood circulation. (Note, we cannot exclude paracellular transport through the alveolar epithelium but in contrast to the trans- cellular NP transport the paracellular pathway has not been validated experimentally under healthy conditions as reviewed by Oberd\u00f6rster et al. (2005). Once 192IrNP are circulating in blood they need to cross the BBB via endothelial vascular cells in the brain (systemic route). For the sake of completeness the indirect neuronal pathway from the LRT has to be noted from enervated cells of the intrathoracic airways via the vagus nerve and eventually to the brain. From our long-term study after intratracheal inhalation we know that the 192IrNP fraction in the brain increases during the next seven days (Kreyling et al., 2002; Semmler et al., 2004; Semmler-Behnke et al., 2007). Unfortunately, the corresponding data after nose-only in- halation are not available. A similar increase of 192IrNP fractions was also observed in liver, spleen, kidneys and heart during the next seven days indicating continued translocation via the \u201csystemic route\u201d to- wards all secondary organs and \u2013 as we show here \u2013 into the remaining carcass consisting of the skeleton and soft tissues. This clearly indicates a prominent role of the systemic translocation route from the LRT. Comparing the olfactory mucosa of the rat with that of the human nose, the surface area of the rat olfactory mucosa normalized to entire nasal mucosa is about 50%, while it is only 5% in the human nose (Oberd\u00f6rster et al., 2005). This may be the result of different evolution of the two species, since the smelling sensation of rats is muchmore ef- ficiently developed than in the human nose. Therefore, it is likely that NP translocation via the olfactory route in the human nose is less prob- able than in the rat nose. However, a direct comparison is missing and, in addition, there are more biochemical processes involved which may mediate the olfactory NP translocation. Similarly, there are no human data on the NP translocation across the human ABB and, hence, there are no data describing the NP biokinetics in blood circulation leading to NP accumulation in secondary organs like the brain. Those human biokinetics studies are of urgent in- terest in the next future. 5. Conclusion Translocation of inhaled 192IrNP towards the brain was distin- guished either from the URT or the LRT by the analysis of two different inhalation exposures \u2013 nose-only inhalation or intratracheal inhalation. Translocation from theURT is significantly higher (8-fold) than from the LRT. Although the accumulated 192IrNP fraction in the brain is rather low compared to total NP deposition after this short-term exposure, this study proofs that inhaled insoluble NP can accumulate in the brain from both \u2013 URT and LRT. When normalizing the translocation to the estimated 192IrNP deposition dose in the URT versus the LRT, the translocation from URT increases 45-fold compared to that from LRT emphasizing the importance of the neuronal pathways from the URT.

For the sake of completeness the indirect neuronal pathway from the LRT has to be noted from enervated cells of the intrathoracic airways via the vagus nerve and eventually to the brain. From our long-term study after intratracheal inhalation we know that the 192IrNP fraction in the brain increases during the next seven days (Kreyling et al., 2002; Semmler et al., 2004; Semmler-Behnke et al., 2007). Unfortunately, the corresponding data after nose-only in- halation are not available. A similar increase of 192IrNP fractions was also observed in liver, spleen, kidneys and heart during the next seven days indicating continued translocation via the \u201csystemic route\u201d to- wards all secondary organs and \u2013 as we show here \u2013 into the remaining carcass consisting of the skeleton and soft tissues. This clearly indicates a prominent role of the systemic translocation route from the LRT. Comparing the olfactory mucosa of the rat with that of the human nose, the surface area of the rat olfactory mucosa normalized to entire nasal mucosa is about 50%, while it is only 5% in the human nose (Oberd\u00f6rster et al., 2005). This may be the result of different evolution of the two species, since the smelling sensation of rats is muchmore ef- ficiently developed than in the human nose. Therefore, it is likely that NP translocation via the olfactory route in the human nose is less prob- able than in the rat nose. However, a direct comparison is missing and, in addition, there are more biochemical processes involved which may mediate the olfactory NP translocation. Similarly, there are no human data on the NP translocation across the human ABB and, hence, there are no data describing the NP biokinetics in blood circulation leading to NP accumulation in secondary organs like the brain. Those human biokinetics studies are of urgent in- terest in the next future. 5. Conclusion Translocation of inhaled 192IrNP towards the brain was distin- guished either from the URT or the LRT by the analysis of two different inhalation exposures \u2013 nose-only inhalation or intratracheal inhalation. Translocation from theURT is significantly higher (8-fold) than from the LRT. Although the accumulated 192IrNP fraction in the brain is rather low compared to total NP deposition after this short-term exposure, this study proofs that inhaled insoluble NP can accumulate in the brain from both \u2013 URT and LRT. When normalizing the translocation to the estimated 192IrNP deposition dose in the URT versus the LRT, the translocation from URT increases 45-fold compared to that from LRT emphasizing the importance of the neuronal pathways from the URT.

The mechanisms of Cd action are associated with the effect on the rate of bone turnover, which depends on the stage of the skeletal devel- opment and disorders in Ca metabolism. Cd leads to low bone turnover at the stage of intensive skeletal development and induces high bone turnover due to enhanced resorption at the stage of the consolidation of bone mass and at skeletal maturity. A very important finding of this study consists of revealing the damaging Cd effect on the growing skeleton at the exposure corresponding to the general population expo- sure. The findings support our previous evidence (Brzo\u0301ska and Moniuszko-Jakoniuk, in press; Brzo\u0301ska et al., 2003c, 2004) that environmental exposure to Cd may be a risk factor for skeletal damage. Thus, it seems recommendable to reduce Cd exposure during growth and in the further life to a minimum, even though the animal data need confirmation from epidemiological studies.

On the other hand, DB rats receiving a 10-fold lower dose of TA (30 mg/kg) exhibited delayed up regulation of MAPK signaling that delayed the expression of CD1 and pRb, explaining delayed tissue repair observed in this group.

Additional studies are currently underway in rats to investigate toxicological responses at lower doses and to search for other biological pathways that may be af- fected by TBBPA exposure. Finally, the approach used here to sample uterine tissue may have maximized the ability to detect baseline changes in some genes and suggests that concentrations of estrogen and estrogenic metabolites may vary in the uterus of TBBPA-treated rats relative to distance from the ovaries. Differential responses ob- served in the two assayed sections of the uterus may be of importance to future study design involving the tissue.

The coumarin umbelliferone caused a tissue-dependent transient vasodilatation de- pendent on nitric oxide production, which may be due to a differential expression of its molecular target. Consideration of these data prompts several questions. Are these effects we observe, mediated as they are through distinct mechanisms, additive or synergistic when the individ- ual components of chamomile are reconstituted?Additionally, our find- ings are all based on acute observations in vitro. What are the effects of long-term exposure to these compounds in vivo? Furthermore, the sim- ilar effects of apigenin and luteolin prompt an evaluation of more structurally-divergent flavonoids. We plan to address these questions in the near future. Conflict of interest statement No conflict to disclose. Conflict of interest statement References"}},

This isoform is substantially more sensitive to pyrethroid insecticides than is Nav1.2, both of which are expressed abundantly in the adult brain. The sensitivity of Nav1.6 sodium channels, coupled with their expression in regions of the brain whose function is selectively disrupted during pyrethroid intoxication and region of brain neurons involved in action potential generation and synaptic transmission, implies that actions of pyrethroids on Nav1.6- containing channels are likely to be important role in determining the systemic neurotoxicity of pyrethroid insecticides.

Decreases in Arc+, Fos+ or Jun+ neurons in the dentate GCL, cingulate cortex or cerebellar vermis at the end of 28-day glycidol exposure may represent a suppressed neuronal plasticity. In contrast, the increased numbers of Arc+ and Fos+ neurons in the dentate GCL only at the adult stage after developmental glycidol exposure may represent delayed increase of neuronal plasticity as a restoration mechanism in this structure in response to aberrations in neurogenesis at the end of exposure.

This study also highlights relevance of p21 (WAF1/ CIP1)-independent apoptosis and significance of alterations in Bax/Bcl2 ratio favoring apoptosis and antitumor effect both in vitro as well as in vivo (Gibson et al., 1999; Huang et al., 2003). Our results are consistent with those reported for combination of chemotherapeutic agents with CPA against breast cancer cells (Friery et al., 2000). These observations suggest that combination chemotherapy may derive its efficacy partly, through coordinated regulation of specific gene products associated with apoptosis. Moreover, characterization of molecular events that underlie suscept- ibility of specific tumor cells to combination chemother- apeutic regimens may lead to additional improvements in treatment strategies for cancers.

{"http://tableXtr.pdf/extractedFrom": "file://../../../TAP-acquisition/PDF_TAP/Dual-actions-of-lindane----hexachlorocyclohexane--on-_2010_Toxicology-and-Ap.pdf", "PDF_pmid_URI": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20600211", "content": {"CoiStatement": "Additional concern arises from the detection of lindane in breast milk at concentrations ranging from 0.23 up to 106 ng/g l.w. (corresponding with approx. 0.03\u201315 nM; e.g., Mueller et al., 2008; Prachar et al., 1993), in cord serum at concentrations up to 100 ng/ml (corresponding with approx. 190 nM in whole cord blood; (Jimenez- Torres et al., 2006), and children's blood levels in some communities easily reaching 8200 ng/g l.w. (corresponding with approx. 315 nM) (Trejo-Acevedo et al., 2009). Considering the bioaccumulative prop- erties of lindane in vivo, it is not unlikely that in extreme cases high nanomolar or even low micromolar brain levels can be reached. This indicates that the developing brain, which is more vulnerable for neurotoxic insults (Singal and Thami, 2006), is at risk of being chronically exposed to concentrations of lindane even less than1 order of magnitude lower than our in vitro acute exposure LOECs for disturbance of Ca2+ homeostasis and dopamine exocytosis. In case of in vivo exposure to non-lethal concentrations of lindane the acute toxic effect will consist of a combination of the known inhibition of postsynaptic GABA and glycine receptors with (non- receptor-mediated) presynaptic disturbance of dopaminergic neuro- transmission by membrane depolarization and disturbance of [Ca2+]i. As dopaminergic neurotransmission is under inhibitory control of GABA, it can be expected that the effect of lindane-induced GABA receptor inhibition will add up to the lindane-induced disturbance of dopaminergic neurotransmission. However, sophisticated experi- ments in neural networks, consisting of dopaminergic neurons and GABA-ergic neurons, are required to resolve this issue. Although acute dopaminergic cell death following lindane expo- sure in vitro was not observed, it is not unlikely that prolonged exposure in vivo results in cell death and neurodegeneration. In particular since disturbance of Ca2+ and dopamine homeostasis as well as increased ROS production, appear to play a pivotal role in neurodegeneration of dopaminergic brain areas (for review see: Mattson, 2007; Bartels and Leenders, 2009). Intracellular accumula- tion of lindane and an enduring disturbance of GABA/glycine-ergic and dopaminergic neurotransmission might provide an additional basis for cell death and neurodegeneration in vivo (for review see: Mariussen and Fonnum, 2006). Furthermore, perinatal exposure to organochlorine pesticides has been linked to increased vulnerability to develop PD later in life (Barlow et al., 2007) and even more interesting, significantly elevated levels of lindane (concentrations up to 1.4 \u03bcg/g l.w., corresponding with 0.6 \u03bcM; calculated using average physiological values) have been detected in the substantia nigra of Parkinson's patients (Corrigan et al., 1996; Corrigan et al., 2000). This is only 1 order of magnitude lower than our LOECs for acute disturbance of Ca2+ homeostasis, dopamine exocytosis and ROS production obtained in vitro, and 1\u20132 orders of magnitude above plasma levels in the general population. This illustrates that, although general population-based plasma levels are apparently well below the reported LOECs, tissue levels can approach in vitro effect concentra- tions, which raises specific concern for highly exposed individuals, especially children (see also above). The observed effect concentrations for both increased basal [Ca2+]i (LOEC 10 \u03bcM; calculated EC50: 11 \u03bcM;) and inhibition of depolariza- tion-evoked increase in [Ca2+]i (LOEC 3 \u03bcM; calculated IC50: 8 \u03bcM) are in the same lowmicromolar range as the effect levels of the presumed primary mode of action, i.e., inhibition of GABAA (IC50: 6 \u03bcM) and glycine (IC50: 5 \u03bcM; Vale et al., 2003) receptors. It can thus be concluded that modulation of intracellular Ca2+ homeostasis as well as (dopaminergic) exocytosis, contribute to the neurotoxic potential of lindane. As the reported effect concentrations for the (postsynap- tic) presumed primary mechanism of action are in the same range as reported here for presynaptic effects, the current findings must be taken into account for human risk assessment. In particular since human tissue levels in extreme cases are close to the LOECs reported here for acute effects. Conflict of interest statement There are no conflicts of interest.

(corresponding with approx. 0.03\u201315 nM; e.g., Mueller et al., 2008; Prachar et al., 1993), in cord serum at concentrations up to 100 ng/ml (corresponding with approx. 190 nM in whole cord blood; (Jimenez- Torres et al., 2006), and children's blood levels in some communities easily reaching 8200 ng/g l.w. (corresponding with approx. 315 nM) (Trejo-Acevedo et al., 2009). Considering the bioaccumulative prop- erties of lindane in vivo, it is not unlikely that in extreme cases high nanomolar or even low micromolar brain levels can be reached. This indicates that the developing brain, which is more vulnerable for neurotoxic insults (Singal and Thami, 2006), is at risk of being chronically exposed to concentrations of lindane even less than1 order of magnitude lower than our in vitro acute exposure LOECs for disturbance of Ca2+ homeostasis and dopamine exocytosis. In case of in vivo exposure to non-lethal concentrations of lindane the acute toxic effect will consist of a combination of the known inhibition of postsynaptic GABA and glycine receptors with (non- receptor-mediated) presynaptic disturbance of dopaminergic neuro- transmission by membrane depolarization and disturbance of [Ca2+]i. As dopaminergic neurotransmission is under inhibitory control of GABA, it can be expected that the effect of lindane-induced GABA receptor inhibition will add up to the lindane-induced disturbance of dopaminergic neurotransmission. However, sophisticated experi- ments in neural networks, consisting of dopaminergic neurons and GABA-ergic neurons, are required to resolve this issue. Although acute dopaminergic cell death following lindane expo- sure in vitro was not observed, it is not unlikely that prolonged exposure in vivo results in cell death and neurodegeneration. In particular since disturbance of Ca2+ and dopamine homeostasis as well as increased ROS production, appear to play a pivotal role in neurodegeneration of dopaminergic brain areas (for review see: Mattson, 2007; Bartels and Leenders, 2009). Intracellular accumula- tion of lindane and an enduring disturbance of GABA/glycine-ergic and dopaminergic neurotransmission might provide an additional basis for cell death and neurodegeneration in vivo (for review see: Mariussen and Fonnum, 2006). Furthermore, perinatal exposure to organochlorine pesticides has been linked to increased vulnerability to develop PD later in life (Barlow et al., 2007) and even more interesting, significantly elevated levels of lindane (concentrations up to 1.4 \u03bcg/g l.w., corresponding with 0.6 \u03bcM; calculated using average physiological values) have been detected in the substantia nigra of Parkinson's patients (Corrigan et al., 1996; Corrigan et al., 2000). This is only 1 order of magnitude lower than our LOECs for acute disturbance of Ca2+ homeostasis, dopamine exocytosis and ROS production obtained in vitro, and 1\u20132 orders of magnitude above plasma levels in the general population. This illustrates that, although general population-based plasma levels are apparently well below the reported LOECs, tissue levels can approach in vitro effect concentra- tions, which raises specific concern for highly exposed individuals, especially children (see also above). The observed effect concentrations for both increased basal [Ca2+]i (LOEC 10 \u03bcM; calculated EC50: 11 \u03bcM;) and inhibition of depolariza- tion-evoked increase in [Ca2+]i (LOEC 3 \u03bcM; calculated IC50: 8 \u03bcM) are in the same lowmicromolar range as the effect levels of the presumed primary mode of action, i.e., inhibition of GABAA (IC50: 6 \u03bcM) and glycine (IC50: 5 \u03bcM; Vale et al., 2003) receptors. It can thus be concluded that modulation of intracellular Ca2+ homeostasis as well as (dopaminergic) exocytosis, contribute to the neurotoxic potential of lindane. As the reported effect concentrations for the (postsynap- tic) presumed primary mechanism of action are in the same range as reported here for presynaptic effects, the current findings must be taken into account for human risk assessment. In particular since human tissue levels in extreme cases are close to the LOECs reported here for acute effects. Conflict of interest statement There are no conflicts of interest.

Kim et al. / Toxicology and Applied Pharmacology 265 (2012) 61\u201372 al., 2010). SSRIs are thought to be much safer than tricyclic antidepres- sants, with a low risk of embryonic toxicity. However, preclinical and clinical studies have reported that fetal exposure to SSRIs increases the risk of adverse effects during fetal and neonatal development (Kallen, 2004; Louik et al., 2007; Kallen and Olausson, 2008). Several studies ofmothers taking SSRIs during pregnancy have indicated poten- tially hazardous effects of these antidepressants on prenatal develop- ment (Hemels et al., 2005; Wogelius et al., 2006). Fluoxetine is categorized under fetal risk factor C. Category C indicates that studies in animals have revealed adverse effects on the fetus (teratogenic, embryocidal, or other) and that there are no controlled studies in women or that no studies in women or animals are available. Drugs should be given only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus (Briggs et al., 2011). Because the antidepressant effects of fluoxetine have a slow onset, the drug has to be administered for a long time to women suffering from depression. Therefore, in this study, the embryonic development inhibited by long-term exposure to fluoxetine was an important factor. Because more complex mecha- nisms exist in vivo than in vitro, the interpretation of in vivo experimen- tal data is more difficult than that of in vitro data. In addition, the results can vary between in vitro and in vivo experiments. However, in vitro experiments could explain the cytotoxic effects of fluoxetine precisely and easily compared to in vivo experiments. In our in vitro experiment, fluoxetine treatment for\u226524 h had a negative effect on early mouse embryonic development. Amongmany early embryos exposed to fluox- etine in vitro, certain embryos underwent blastocyst formation with a normal karyotype. However, in vivo in humans, an oocyte is normally fertilized by a sperm and develops into a blastocyst. Therefore, we sug- gest that takingfluoxetinemust be carefully considered forwomanwho desire pregnancy, at least during early pregnancy. In addition, the selec- tion of the treatment dosage and duration will affect early embryonic development and implantation.

The increase in GSTp protein induced by VCD is highest at the time that follicle loss is first seen (d6). The interaction of GSTp with JNK corresponds to inhibition of JNK activity, as demonstrated by the reduction in its downstream target, p-c-Jun. Taken together, these findings are in support of a protective role for GSTp in the ovary, by catalyzing VCD-GSH adduct formation and by inhibiting the action of JNK. Ultimately, however, it is possible that the repeated chemical assault may compromise the capacity of GSTp to carry out both roles and ovotoxicity commences. These findings raise concerns about low-dose repeated exposure of women to ovotoxic chemicals which may pose a risk equal to or greater than a single exposure to a higher dose (Borman et al., 2000).

Methods 18, 739\u2013743.", "Acknowledgement": "This study points at the importance of early medical intervention following exposure to Cl2 in order to prevent acute and long-term lung injuries. Both high-dose (100 mg/kg) and relatively low-dose (10 mg/kg) of dexamethasone decreased the risk for developing de- layed effects such as persistent lung injuries, while only high-dose treatment could significantly counteract acute-phase effects. Our data implicate the importance of early treatment with corticosteroids in Cl2-induced lung injury in consistency with our previously published data in a mouse model of alkylating mustard agent exposure. By using this mouse model, it is possible to increase the understanding of how corticosteroids exert their therapeutic effect in chemical- induced lung injuries, but the model is also of value in the search for complementary pharmaceutical approaches targeting disease pathways other than inflammation. The results provide a foundation for future studies aimed at identifying new concepts for treatment of chemical-induced lung injury. In particular, studies addressing com- bination of anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidant treatment are highly motivated.

One lead- ing hypothesis is that TCDD inhibits programmed cell death of the me- dial edge epithelial (MEE) cells of palatal shelves, and that TCDD alters MEE cell proliferation and differentiation (Cuervo and Covarrubias, 2004; Jin and Ding, 2006). These results provided a mechanism by which TCDD is able to disrupted epidermal homeostasis. Our results support the hypothesis that cleft palate in TCDD-exposed embryos might be due to problems concerning acceleration of cell proliferation. Numerous studies have shown cell-cycle-dependent effects of TCDD on gene expression and AHR-dependent and -independent effects of TCDD on cell-cycle progression (Denison et al., 2011; Faust et al., 2013). Collectively, one of the new findings in the present study is that proliferation of hFPECs promoted by TCDD is mediated by PI3K/ Akt signaling and its upstream components, such as PDK1 and PTEN, through an AhR-dependent manner.

While Kupffer cells do not contribute to these changes in hepatic transporters, they are required for hepatoprotection fromAlOH toxicity. The selective up-regulation of Mrp4 in hepatocytes surrounding the central vein warrants further investigation into the specific mechanism of Mrp4 induction in this subset of hepatocytes. Given thatMrp4 is up-regulated in centrilobular hepatocytes, distant from the region of AlOH-induced hepatocyte damage, it would be interesting to determine if pretreatment of mice with AlOH would protect from a subsequent, higher AlOH dose. This may help provide clues as to the role of enhanced Mrp4 expression in development of tolerance to hepatotoxicant exposure. Acknowledgments Sarah Campion is a PhRMA Foundation Predoctoral Fellow.

Moreover, these find- ings document that baicalin offers protection against postischemic in- jury in alcoholic fatty liver by reducing the hepatocellular damage through suppression of the TLR4-mediated inflammatory signaling pathway. Therefore, pretreatment with baicalin might be useful as a potential pharmacological maneuver for attenuating I/R injury in al- coholic fatty liver.

It has been previously suggested, by results obtained using ELISA analysis, that plasma VTG levels of small fish species are responsive to estrogen treatment (Jensen and Ankley, 2006; Miller et al., 2007). However, in our present study, zebrafish vtgAo1, the major estrogen responsive VTG form in teleosts, was found in some extrahepatic locations, such as the heart and brain. The expression of zebrafish vtgAo1 in heart tissue can be suppressed by adrenergic agonists, similar to our recent studies on the Chinese rare minnow vtgAo1 (Ma et al., 2009). In addition, by using ELISA analysis, we demonstrated that the circulating level of zebrafish vtgAo1 could be significantly stimulated by MOXI, an adrenergic antagonist, which seems to be at least partially independent of estrogen responsive signals. The circulating level of fish VTG is generally considered to be a sensitive biomarker for monitoring estrogenic effects. Our work provides the first evidence that VTG expression can also be regulated by adrenergic reagents. These observations challenge the specificity of the teleost VTG assays for environmental endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs) screening. Thus, further characterization of the teleost VTG gene family may provide new insights into the physiological functions of VTGs and mechanisms that regulate its expression.

Indeed, CeO2 exposure sub- stantially increased interstitial collagen level was correlated with the persistent presence of CeO2 in the exposed lung tissue, as demonstrated by EDX analysis. A thin coating of aSiO2 on CeO2 reduced CeO2 induced inflammatory response, decreased TIMP-MMP-9 ratio, reduced the ac- cumulation of surfactant in the air space, and reduced CeO2-induced in- terstitial collagen development. Therefore, the present study supports the \u201csafer by design\u201d concept of encapsulation of CeO2 with a nanothin layer of aSiO2 during their synthesis to partially protect against CeO2-in- duced pulmonary responses, even thoughmeasurable dissolution of the coating from the CeO2 particles occurred. Such a concept may be used for coating other flame generated nanoparticles to mitigate some of the occupational and environmental health concerns.

These studies also show that the low-level As(III) causes an analogous accumulation of high-molecular-weight protein\u2013Ub conju- gates. Furthermore, the effects of low-level As(III) exposure are enhanced by the depletion of GSH, suggesting a protec- tive role by GSH in the prevention of As(III) toxicity.

The toxicity of the compound can be tracked directly using the online respiration assay and the exometabolome analysis permits the estimation of metabolic fluxes and therefore the analysis of effects of the compound on cellularmetabolism. It is also possible to carry out further endpoint assays at the end of the treatment period which allows multiplexing of assays. Hence, complementary and additional information can be obtained from just one experiment in a microtiter plate. The described methodology could also be adapted to high throughput screening. The method could be improved further using 13C metabolic flux analysis which allows a deeper insight into the cellular metabolism. Modulations of fluxes could serve as toxicity indicators and specific flux patterns as signatures of toxicity. The presented systems biology approach could be applied in the future for the elucidation of side effects of compounds during the drug development process and could lead to an overall better under- standing of toxicity at the metabolome level.

Acute Mn exposure increased TH activity, whereas chronic Mn treatment decreased TH activity. Chronic Mn treatment also induced activation of PKC\u03b4, which in turn activated PP2A, resulting in decreased TH activity due to dephosphorylation of TH-Ser40. Our results suggest that Mn-induced decreases in TH activity mediated through PKC\u03b4 and PP2A may explain the dopaminergic deficits observed during chronic Mn exposure.

Phenol-induced changes in TER and paracellular flux of extracellular markers were dependent on the length of exposure to phenol and the concentration employed. Based on these observations we propose that the phenol-induced effects are secondary to changes in the cell membrane resulting in disruption of TJ-containing microdomains. Disruption of these microdomains would result in mislocalization of TJ components and altered paracellular perme- ability. Although, low doses phenol do not compromise cell viability, at high doses, it can lead to cell death. Thus, the in vitro system using SK-CO15 human colonic epithelial cells provides a reasonable model for investigating the action of phenols on epithelial monolayers. Taken together, these findings suggest that cellular membrane microdomains are affected by phenol exposure, thus destabilizing the TJ proteins that regulate epithelial barrier function.

Behavioral changes were less sensitive than changes in thyroid hormone levels, which indicate that setting a NOAEL for OMC based on reductions in thyroid hormone levels, will also be protective against behavioral effects caused by developmental hypothyroxine- mia. Furthermore, our results show that behavioral testing of thyroid disruptors with multiple modes of action provides useful comple- mentary information and contributes to a broader understanding of the toxicity of the tested chemicals, than studies that only take hormonal measurements and development of reproductive organs into account.

These studies identified effects of the \u03b2 subunits on voltage-dependent gating and use-dependent modification that differed markedly from those we found previously in assays of the same sodium channel subunit combinations and insecticides using the Xenopus oocyte expression system (Tan and Soderlund, 2010; Tan and Soderlund, 2011b). Moreover, the actions of these pyrethroids on Nav1.6 channel complexes expressed in HEK293 cells aremuchmore consistentwith the actions of the samepyrethroids on channel complexes of unspecified composition in nativemammalian neurons (Tatebayashi and Narahashi, 1994; Tabarean and Narahashi, 1998; Wu et al., 2009) than are the actions of these compounds on Nav1.6 complexes expressed in oocytes.We conclude from these results that functional reconstitution of channels in vitro requires careful atten- tion to both the subunit composition of channel complexes and the choice of heterologous expression system to ensure that channels in vitro are faithful functional and pharmacological models of channels in neurons.

The aggravating effects were more severe in LPS rich ASD than in SiO2 rich ASD. The TLR4 ligand, LPS was shown to be a strong candidate for the major aggravating substance in ASDs. Our results indicate that the effects of low concentrations of ASD2 in the atmosphere are stronger than high concentrations of ASD1. Although the atmospheric concentra- tions of ASDs are low, ASDs containing toxic materials may result in serious effects on asthmatic patients. The experimental findings in the present study may serve as a warning regarding the adverse effects of wind-borne sand dust on the human respiratory system in northeast Asia.

Komoike, M. Matsuoka / Toxicology and Applied Pharmacology 310 (2016) 68\u201377 activation of eIF2\u03b1\u2013ATF4 signaling pathway, one of the UPR branches. AA exposure increased the mRNA level of pro-apoptotic CHOP and induced apoptosis, and those were suppressed by the chemical chaper- one 4-PBA. In addition, NAC suppressed the AA-induced activation of eIF2\u03b1\u2013ATF4 pathway, CHOP expression, and apoptosis, indicating the involvement of ROS production in this ER stress response. Furthermore, exposure of zebrafish larvae to AA induced the chop mRNA expression and apoptosis in the brain. These in vitro and in vivo findings suggest that AA exposure induces apoptotic neuronal cell death through the ER stress response. A growing body of evidence has revealed that the ER stress and the UPR contribute to the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases (Scheper and Hoozemans, 2015). Investigations on the ER stress response may help understand the toxi- cological mechanisms of AA neurotoxicity.

Recent advances in these genome projects have greatly facilitated the major tasks ahead, which are to identify endogenous substrates and physiological functions for epidermal CYP gene products, and to identify those products having important roles in detoxification and in responses to specific environmental insults. Successful approaches to these problems will provide insight into mechanisms regulating epithelial CYP gene expression and CYP enzyme activities. Intracellular signal- ing pathways will be identified in which CYP proteins have fundamental roles in the formation and disposition of bio- logically activated metabolites affecting the differentiation and functions of epithelia (e.g., CYP2R1, CYP2S1, and the keratinocyte-specific CYP2Bs in rodent skin). Because the epidermis and other stratified squamous epithelia directly interface the environment, they are primary sites of disease, including cancer. Undoubtedly, CYP2 proteins will be found to have roles in the production and disposition of molecules affecting the competency of these epithelial barriers.

These changes in acetylation were correlated with an increase in histone methylation at histone H3K4 and a decrease in methylation at histone H3K9. Though global DNA demethylation was not detected, future studies will be required to examine local changes in methylation status. In summary, these novel findings support the hypothesis that early, transient epigenetic changes contribute to the mechanism of VPA-induced teratogenesis.

Clearly, not all changes in epigenetic programming will have adverse effects on human health, and tissue-specific and species-specific differences in epi- genetic programs need to be considered. Furthermore, epigenetic modifications are likely to vary with the subtle differences in environmental conditions between laborato- ries. For example, genetically identical cells may exhibit distinct epigenetic programs depending on their passage number. Nevertheless, identifying key genes and proteins that govern the epigenetic regulation of gene expression promises to provide significant mechanistic insights into the mode of action of toxicants and should make an important contribution to future risk assessments.

In addition, erdosteine modulated the down-regulation of the anti-apoptotic Bcl-xL protein and the up- regulation of the pro-apoptotic Bax protein in similarly treated cells. In conclusion, the results of this study demonstrated that erdosteine protected auditory hair cells against cisplatin-induced apoptosis via the inhibition of p53 activation and the activation of Nrf2 through PI3K/Akt signaling pathway. This protective action involved the mito- chondrial pathway, which is associated with ROS generation, cyto- chrome c release, and caspase activation. These findings suggest that erdosteine might be clinically useful as a chemoprotective agent that could prevent cisplatin- induced ototoxicity.

Our results suggested that eupafolin as well as a specific Nox2 inhibitor (APO) protected skin from LPS-induced inflammatory response by inhibiting the expression of COX-2 (Figs. 6A and B). Together, our results demonstrate a critical role of Nox2 in LPS-induced COX-2 expression, and suggest that eupafolin may be used in the treatment of skin diseases involving inflammation.

Urinary 8-OHdG levels were clearly corre- lated with arsenic levels in chronic poisoning. 8-OHdG concentrations in urine remained elevated for some time after acute arsenic poisoning. In chronically exposed patients switched to low-arsenic water, DNA damage appeared to return to basal levels in about 1 year. The evidence of skin lesions in this population was also reduced by consumption of low-arsenic water. In the population exposed to acute high dose arsenic, evidence of oxidative damage was transient and returned to normal by 180 days after the acute poisoning event. Thus, apparently, the effects of acute and chronic arsenic poisoning are potentially reversible, at least for the skin, and that DNA damage can be reduced or reversed by placing patients on low-arsenic water. This indicates that replacement of high-arsenic water in areas of endemic arsenic poisoning should be a public health priority.

Kitchin, K. Wallace / Toxicology and Applied Pharmacology 232 (2008) 252\u2013257 changing the protein conformation, function, or pore sizes or proper- ties. Arsenicals are also capable of changing their valence and thus can act as reducing or oxidizing agents. The remaining attractive explanation of arsenic's Fe releasing effects on ferritin is that it simply acts as a redox agent and reduces Fe+++ to Fe++ (the releasable form of Fe). This is consistent with the finding that trivalent arsenicals releasedmore Fe from ferritin than did the corresponding pentavalent arsenical (3.4 and 1.6 for arsenite and arsenate, respectively; 8.7 and 5.4 for MMA(III) and MMA(V), respectively; and 29.8 and 7.1 nM/min for DMA(III) and DMA(V), respectively (Ahmad et al., 2000). If oxidation of only 0.1% of an arsenical [e. g. DMA(III) to DMA(V)] was coupled to Fe reduction and release from ferritin, all the results observed in the Ahmad et al. (2000) study could be explained by arsenicals acting via redox properties (reduced arsenical \u2192 oxidized arsenical coupled to Fe+++ \u2192 Fe++). In the Fe release from ferritin experiments, the tested concentrations of the arsenicals were 10 mM, somewhat more than the 1.0 mM that was used in the binding studies in this paper. Arsenate and possible binding to DNA and histone 3,4 The pentavalent arsenate molecule has either one or two negative charges at physiological pH (the pKa values for H3AsO4 are 2.25, 6.77 and 11.6). Thus, it is not surprising that arsenate did not bind to negatively charged DNA. However, positively charged histones could be an excellent target for binding of arsenate but no such specific binding of arsenate to histone 3,4 was experimentally observed. In situ metal binding of other transition elements and possible sources of DNA oxidation Because this experimental study found no binding of arsenite to either DNA, type II-A histone and histone H3, H4, we must argue strongly that the possible binding of arsenicals and in situ oxidation of DNA is not a viable explanation of arsenic's carcinogenicity. Trivalent arsenicals are expected to be uncharged at physiological pH so are very electrically different from other positively charged transition elements. However, there is positive evidence that in situ binding and DNA oxidation occurs with other transition elements, for example Fe++, Cu++ and Ni++. There is about an 80/1 ratio of Fe to Cu in the human body (Chevion, 1988). With Fe++, the base sequence GGG binds Fe++ preferentially, resulting in structural distortion of DNA and enhanced DNA cleavage (Rai et al., 2005).With combined exposures to Cu++, H2O2 and a Cu ++ binding histone peptide (CH3CO-AKRHRK- CONH2), enhanced DNA fragmentation, formation of 8-hydroxy-2\u2032- deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG) and increased electron spin resonance signal were observed (Midorikawa et al., 2005). Chromatin can concentrate Ni++ more than over 5000-fold over serum, mostly via electrostatic attraction to the phosphate groups of DNA (Rokita and Burrows, 2001). In vitro, exposure to Ni++, nucleohistone and H2O2, enhances 8-OHdG formation (Bal and Kasprzak, 2002). There are known binding sites for Ni++ and Cu++ on histone H2A and histone H3 having the amino acid sequences of CAIH, ESHH and TESHHK (Bal and Kasprzak, 2002). Ni++ also binds to histone H1 and in the presence of H2O2 increases the formation of 8-OHdG in vitro (Huang et al., 1995). When DNA is irradiated, the presence of Mg++ causes an approximate doubling of the production of hydroxyl radicals (Ana- stassopoulou and Theophanides, 2002). Thus, with four different positively charged metals [Fe++, Cu++, Ni++ and Mg++], there is positive evidence demonstrating that in situ binding of biologically active metals close to DNA can lead to enhanced DNA oxidation and damage. Arsenic exposures have also been linked not only to the common reactive oxygen species, but also to arsenic containing species such as dimethylarsenic radical (Yamanaka et al., 1990), dimethylarsenic peroxyl radical (Yamanaka et al., 1990) and dimethylarsenic peroxide (Mizoi et al., 2005). Conclusion At concentrations up to approximately 1 mM, neither DNA nor any of the three proteins studied, type II-A histone, histone 3 or ferritin bound radioactive arsenite in a specific manner. Therefore, it appears highly unlikely that in situ binding of trivalent arsenicals, followed by in situ oxidative DNA damage, can account for arsenic's carcinogeni- city. Arsenite, lacking a positive charge and being predominately bound to Cys moieties of peptides and proteins, does not seem to operate in a similar manner as Fe++, Cu++ and Ni++ in binding close to DNA and causing in situ oxidation of DNA via Haber\u2013Weiss processes. The experimental evidence of this study (lack of arsenite binding to DNA and histones) does not rule out (a) diffusion of longer lived oxidative stress molecules, such as H2O2 into the nucleus and ensuing oxidative DNA damage, (b) redox chemistry by free (unbound) arsenicals in the nucleus or (c) arsenical-induced perturbations in Fe, Cu or other redox active metals which are already the known to oxidize DNA in vitro and in vivo. It is always difficult to rule out Fe- and Cu-mediated pathways in mammalian oxidative stress and carcinogenesis. Even in mammals with a substantial amount of arsenicals from environmental or experimental exposures, there are still orders of magnitude more Cu and Fe present in the mammalian organism than there is total arsenic.

In this table, the general molecular features and properties obtained from the QSAR models to increase toxicity for each endpoint are summarized. This table makes clear two important points: 1) each endpoint depends on a set of mechanistic features distinct from the five others, and 2) the closest to a common feature across the six endpoints is the need for an extended decorator conformation perpendicular to the carbon nanotube's length-wise axis (structure) in order to maximize nanotoxicity for four of the six endpoints. Still, there is no way to guar- antee the proposed mechanisms of action are correct, but they do serve as reasonable hypotheses to test.

Chatterjee et al. / Toxicology and Applied Pharmacology 264 (2012) 182\u2013191 hyperalgesic pathway in affected tissues. Bradykinin and related kinins represent a group of potent inflammatory mediators responsible for pain and inflammation. On the other hand, bradykinin receptors pro- mote pain stimuli and inflammation by the NF-\u03baB pathway (Moreau et al., 2007). Thus, the inhibition of NF-\u03baB activation (Fig. 4) and inflamma- tory enzyme expression may contribute to these beneficial effects of P(3a). The acute peripheral antiinflammatory models are biphasic, in which the early phase is mediated by histamine, serotonin and increased synthesis of prostaglandin E2. Recent studies have shown that carrageen- an also induces peripheral release of nitric oxide (NO), sustained by TNF-\u03b1, IFN-\u03b3 and IL-1\u03b2. The late phase, on the other hand, is sustained by the release of prostaglandin and NO (Ant\u00f4nio and Souza Brito., 1998. Thus, the observed anti-inflammatory effect of P(3a) in the early phases could be related to the suppression of the pro-inflammatory cyto- kines IL-6 and TNF-\u03b1 (Matsumori et al., 1997) and to the blockade of the TNF-\u03b1/NF-\u03baB signaling pathway (Yang et al., 2005). Further, the reduc- tion in paw volume and suppression of swelling caused by the assessed derivative P(3a) reveals that it may be effective in RA, as it interferes with the production of potent pro-inflammatory agents such as TNF-\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2, and IL-6. In addition to the above mechanism, P(3a) might sup- press the activation of NF-\u03baB also. In conclusion, our study demonstrates for the first time that P(3a) markedly suppresses cytokine production in vitro and in vivo by inhibiting the NF-\u03baB pathway, and consequently improves the surviv- al of endotoxemic animals. The compound also significantly reduced paw edema (induced by carrageenan and formalin) and CFA mediat- ed arthritic paw swelling with inflammatory pain responses. Thus it can be developed as a valuable protective agent against inflammatory diseases. Supplementary data to this article can be found online at http:// dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.taap.2012.07.032.

Chatterjee et al. / Toxicology and Applied Pharmacology 264 (2012) 182\u2013191 hyperalgesic pathway in affected tissues. Bradykinin and related kinins represent a group of potent inflammatory mediators responsible for pain and inflammation. On the other hand, bradykinin receptors pro- mote pain stimuli and inflammation by the NF-\u03baB pathway (Moreau et al., 2007). Thus, the inhibition of NF-\u03baB activation (Fig. 4) and inflamma- tory enzyme expression may contribute to these beneficial effects of P(3a). The acute peripheral antiinflammatory models are biphasic, in which the early phase is mediated by histamine, serotonin and increased synthesis of prostaglandin E2. Recent studies have shown that carrageen- an also induces peripheral release of nitric oxide (NO), sustained by TNF-\u03b1, IFN-\u03b3 and IL-1\u03b2. The late phase, on the other hand, is sustained by the release of prostaglandin and NO (Ant\u00f4nio and Souza Brito., 1998. Thus, the observed anti-inflammatory effect of P(3a) in the early phases could be related to the suppression of the pro-inflammatory cyto- kines IL-6 and TNF-\u03b1 (Matsumori et al., 1997) and to the blockade of the TNF-\u03b1/NF-\u03baB signaling pathway (Yang et al., 2005). Further, the reduc- tion in paw volume and suppression of swelling caused by the assessed derivative P(3a) reveals that it may be effective in RA, as it interferes with the production of potent pro-inflammatory agents such as TNF-\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2, and IL-6. In addition to the above mechanism, P(3a) might sup- press the activation of NF-\u03baB also. In conclusion, our study demonstrates for the first time that P(3a) markedly suppresses cytokine production in vitro and in vivo by inhibiting the NF-\u03baB pathway, and consequently improves the surviv- al of endotoxemic animals. The compound also significantly reduced paw edema (induced by carrageenan and formalin) and CFA mediat- ed arthritic paw swelling with inflammatory pain responses. Thus it can be developed as a valuable protective agent against inflammatory diseases. Supplementary data to this article can be found online at http:// dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.taap.2012.07.032.

Nwosu et al. / Toxicology and Applied Pharmacology 196 (2004) 37\u201346 45 example, under what conditions does c-myc switch from its role in apoptosis to cell proliferation? The immortalizing function of NFnB, as it relates to the rescue of cells from apoptosis, is of interest because cells that have sustained irreparable DNA-damage may then be maintained. The actions of c-myc and activated ras may transform such cells. The transformed cells may proceed to clonal expan- sion that results in benign lesions. Although the expression of p53 was not significantly increased in BZ-exposed mice relative to control mice, its role in this process is of great interest because p53 interacts with and regulates many genes involved in cell cycle arrest, DNA-repair, and apoptosis. It is involved in trans-activating p21, mdm2, gadd45 (Shackelford et al., 1999), and also regulates expression of several genes involved in apoptosis includ- ing bax and fas (Miyashita and Reed, 1995). In addition, p53 processes signals from myc through p19 (Zindy et al., 1998). Understanding the interactions among these various participants in a longer exposure study would enable a better understanding of a mechanistic process of neoplastic transformation of HPCs by BZ.

DISCUSSION The results of this study indicate that multiple P450 en- zymes, including CYP2A6, CYP2A13, CYP2B6, and CYP2J2, as well as the P450 reductase and mEH, are expressed in the OM and liver of human fetuses. More importantly, although the concentrations of these biotransformation enzymes were generally lower in OM than in the liver, much higher levels of the CYP2A proteins were detected in OM than in liver micro- somes. These findings call for further studies to assess the metabolic capacity of fetal OM and the toxicological implica- tions of the prenatal tissue-selective expression of the CYP2A enzymes. Although a number of P450 enzymes, including CYP1A1, 1B1, 2C8, 2D6, 2E1, 3A4, and 3A7, have been detected in human fetal liver and several of these have also been detected in extrahepatic tissues in previous studies (cf. Hakkola et al., 1998), the occurrence of biotransformation enzymes in human fetal OM and the prenatal expression of the CYP2A enzymes have not been reported previously. In one earlier immunoblot study, an immunoreactive band was detected in human fetal adrenal microsomes with an anti-CYP2A5 antibody, but not in fetal liver microsomes; however, the detected adrenal protein was probably not CYP2A6 or CYPA13 since it had a lower migration rate than that of the CYP2A6 in adult human liver microsomes (Maenpaa et al., 1993). Both CYP2A6 and CYP2A13 are highly active in the met- abolic activation of many toxicants and procarcinogens, such as N-nitrosodiethylamine, 2,6-dichlorobenzonitrile, and hexa- methylphosphoramide (cf. Fernandez-Salguero and Gonzalez, 1995; Liu et al., 1996; Thornton-Manning et al., 1997; Su et al., unpublished results). Of particular interest, heterologously expressed CYP2A13 was highly active in the metabolic acti- FIG. 4.

The protein levels are hown in arbitrary units, with OM levels set as 1.0.

Thus, the preferential expression of the CYP2A enzymes in fetal OM may have significant implications in human developmental toxicology. To this end, transplacental transfer of NNK from women who smoke cigarettes to fetuses has been demonstrated (Lackmann et al., 1999). Moreover, in adult rodents, numerous xenobiotic compounds are known to cause tissue-selective toxicity in the OM, leading to olfactory neuronal degeneration and tumor formation (Belinsky et al., 1987; Bonnefoi et al., 1991; Dahl and Hadley, 1991; Genter et al., 1992; Gu et al., 1997); these toxicities often occur as a result of tissue-specific metabolic activation of the foreign compounds by OM-selec- tive P450 enzymes (e.g., Gu et al. 1997; Zhuo et al. 1999). Olfactory toxicity in the perinatal period may have a greater impact on behavior, growth, and development than in adults. Cytotoxicity in human fetal OM may lead to transient or long-term defects in olfactory ability in the newborn, which could cause feeding problems and potentially result in inade- quate development of the patient. In addition, human fetuses are believed to possess olfactory function (Schaal et al., 1998), disruption of which could potentially affect the social interac- tion and well-being of the newborn.

We have provided the first evidence of an increased susceptibility of hOgg1- and Fpg-expressing cells to MeHg-initiated cytotoxicity, implicating BER status as a critical determinant of risk. The variability in Ogg1 activitymay constitute an important determinant of risk for pa- thologies mediated by DNA lesions repaired via BER given the range of human variability in DNA repair activity, whereOgg1mRNA levels were estimated to vary 5-10-fold (Vogel et al., 2002), with interindividual variation in Ogg1 activity in healthy subjects estimated to be 2.8-fold (Paz-Elizur et al., 2007). However, more information correlating the full range of DNA repair activities from low to substantially above average with in vivo consequences is required to fully understand the role of altered BER capacity as a risk factor for environmentally- initiated pathologies, as the in vivo consequences of altered DNA repair activity may differ significantly from those in vitro, and may also differ by the nature of the environmental toxin. This paradoxical effect might also prove useful in cancer therapy wherein, combined with glycosylase overexpression, the judicious selection of a DNA- damaging drug with effects similar to MeHg could be employed as a therapeutic agent for selectively destroying proliferating cancer cells. Given that MeHg toxicity remains a significant public health concern today, and that other environmental contaminants may share similar mechanisms of action, additional research is warranted to better understand the underlying molecular mechanisms and risk factors for MeHg toxicity, especially in vivo. Doing so will allow for the development of novel biomarkers of exposure for environmental toxicants, and therapeutic interventions, which to date are limited in cases of MeHg poisoning.

However, when the skin reservoir is significant compared to levels in receptor fluid, the contribution of the skin reservoir to systemic absorption should be exam- ined. Extended absorption studies in conjunction with additional information on skin localization (e.g., confocal laser cytometry and tape stripping), skin binding studies, and vehicles effects can help to determine the fate of the skin reservoir. The potential for a chemical to form a skin reservoir can be at least partially predicted by the extent of protein binding, rate of penetration through skin, and the chemical\u2019s solubility properties (Miselnicky et al., 1988). It is also important that studies are conducted in a manner that measure absorption of chemicals simulating realistic use conditions that can be easily applied to human exposure situations. Additional investigation and characterization of the skin reservoir will provide data that can be used to realistically refine the exposure assessment for dermally applied chemicals.

Borm et al. / Toxicology and Applied Pharmacology 205 (2005) 157\u2013167166 (Bevan and Yonda, 1985) and that below a certain monolayer surface load (15%) with exogenous PAHs little to no leaching takes place. Our work more or less confirms that in one CB with the highest PAH content and a moderate surface area, release of PAH is just enough to cause unidentified DNA adduct spots in the DRZ. The data also add up to the evidence that PAHs play no significant role in the induction of lung tumors upon inhalation of ultrafine and fine CB in rats (Borm et al., 2004; Dasenbrock et al., 1996). The use of high doses of organic particles loaded with PAHs is therefore limited to mechanistic interpretations. The carcinogenic action of CBs in the rat is generally considered as the chronic endpoint of persistent inflammation and cell proliferation during expo- sures leading to overload (Borm et al., 2004; Gallagher et al., 2003; Greim et al., 2001). Among the responsible mediators, reactive oxygen and nitrogen species (ROS, RNS) play a crucial role in genotoxicity, mutagenicity, and cell prolifer- ation pathways (Knaapen et al., 2004). Although PAHs can also be activated by ROS generated by neutrophils and form adducts in epithelial cells (Borm et al., 1997), the contribution of this mechanism to PAH\u2013DNA adduct formation was not detectable in the current as well as in previous (Gallagher et al., 1994) in vivo studies reaching overload conditions.
