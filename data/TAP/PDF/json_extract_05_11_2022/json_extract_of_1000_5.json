The occurrence of unavoidable carry-over of coccidiostats and histomonostats in non-target feed, even below maximum levels that were set under Directive 2002/32/EC, may result in the presence of residues of these substances in food products of animal origin. 8 Council Regulation (EEC) No 2377/90 of 26 June 1990 laying down a Community procedure for the establishment of maximum residue limits of veterinary medicinal products in foodstuffs of animal origin.

Therefore, in order to protect public health, and insofar there is no maximum residue limit (MRL) yet fixed for the specific food concerned, maximum levels for the presence of active substances contained in coccidiostats and histomonostats have been established in food of animal origin originating from the non-target feed concerned, in the context of Council Regulation (EEC) No 315/93 of 8 February 1993 laying down Community procedures for contami- nants in food9 (Table 9).

This is associated with increased mRNA expression of antioxidant enzymes including Cu,Zn-SOD, catalase, TrxR, GSTA1-2, GSTP1, and mGST2. At the same time, CEES stimulates expression of key enzymes important in the production of prostaglandins and leukotrienes, including, COX-2, mPGES-2, PGDS, 5-LOX, LTA4 hydro- lase and LTC4 synthase. The MAP kinase signal transduction pathways appear to be important in mediating expression of several of these enzymes. Whether or not changes in expression of these enzymes mediate inflammation or protect the skin from sulfur mustard toxicity will depend on the levels of expression of functional proteins for these enzymes, as well as their roles in repairing or enhancing cellular damage. Our data also demonstrate that the skin construct model may be useful in understanding the responses of keratinocytes to sulfur mustard-induced toxicity.

Nicotine dose-dependently impairs HR responsiveness to baroreceptor unloading via inhibition of the A2A adenosine receptor- mediated control of reflex sympathoexcitatory outflow to cardiac tissues. In support of this conclusion are the observations: (i) acute nicotine suppressed reflex tachycardic and not bradycardic responses, (ii) the inhibitory effect of nicotine on BRSSNP was abolished after \u03b2- adrenergic and notmuscarinic blockade, and (iii) selective blockade of A2A adenosine receptors diminished reflex increases in HR and abolished BRSSNP attenuation caused by subsequently administered nicotine. This pattern of autonomic changes produced by nicotine is likely to influence compensatory sympathoexcitatory responses that associate conditions such as hypothalamic defense response, posture changes, and ventricular rhythms.

Several of the aflatoxin-specific biomarkers have been validated in epidemiological studies and are now being used as intermediate biomarkers in prevention studies. The development of these aflatoxin biomarkers has been based upon the knowledge of the biochemistry and toxicology of aflatoxins gleaned from both experimental and human studies. These biomarkers have subsequently been utilized in experimental models to provide data on the modulation of these markers under different situations of disease risk. This systematic approach provides encouragement for preventive interventions and should serve as a template for the development, validation and application of other chemical- specific biomarkers to cancer or other chronic diseases.

Sunil et al. / Toxicology and Applied Pharmacology 261 (2012) 22\u201330 (Leme et al., 2010), total lung resistance and central airway resistance increased in bothWT and iNOS\u2212/\u2212mice, while compliance decreased in response tomethacholine challenge. CEES administration toWTmice resulted in increased total lung resistance in associationwith decreased lung compliance 3 days post-exposure. These observations suggest that CEES-induced injury and inflammation lead to airflow obstruction and stiffening of the lungs. In contrast, only minimal changes in central air- way resistance and static compliance were observed at this early time point, indicating that hyper-responsiveness occurs in the lower airways and results in a loss of parenchymal tethering. Loss of iNOS resulted in a reduced methacholine response 3 days following CEES administration demonstrating that iNOS-derived RNS are involved in the response. At 14 days post-treatment, a time when much of the inflammation has re- solved inWTmice, the onlymajor functional changewas a hyperrespon- sive central airway resistance, indicative of upper airway constriction. This response was also seen in iNOS\u2212/\u2212mice, but accompanied by el- evated lung compliance. This observation is consistent with the appar- ent increase in reparative processes observed in iNOS\u2212/\u2212 animals. Our findings demonstrate that RNS contribute to increases in airway tone and parenchymal damage induced by CEES. In summary, the present studies demonstrate that lung injury, in- flammation and oxidative stress induced by CEES are mediated in part by RNS. These findings are in accord with previous studies in rats treated with nitrogen mustard using antioxidants or the iNOS inhibi- tor aminoguanidine (Korkmaz et al., 2006; Ucar et al., 2007; Yaren et al., 2007), suggesting that it is the absence of iNOS and not differences in biological pathways and immune function that underlie reduce sensitivity of iNOS\u2212/\u2212 mice to CEES. iNOS is also important in the pathogenesis of pulmonary diseases observed after vesicant expo- sure, such as asthma, acute respiratory distress syndrome and COPD (Chen, 2009; Ghanei and Harandi, 2011; Sugiura and Ichinose, 2011). These data suggest that targeting iNOS may be an efficacious approach to mitigating acute vesicant-induced pulmonary injury and long term disease pathogenesis.", "Acknowledgement": "Acknowledgments This work was supported by National Institutes of Health, grants AR055073, ES004738, CA132624 and GM034310.

In addition, the PI3K and p38MAPK path- ways are involved in Nrf2/HO-1 activation by nano-Ag. From the view that nano-Ag utility and human exposure are rapidly increasing, our findings provide supportive information that nano-Ag exposure might beharmful to humanhealth. In particular, nano-Ag is applied tomedical products such as wound dressing and ventricular catheter to prevent infection. This raises a hypothetical concern that the use of nano-Ag- containing medical products should be monitored carefully in specific human populations with high risk factors. In fact, genetic polymor- phisms have been identified in the human Nrf2 and HO-1 promoters, and thesemutations are found to cause a reduction in functional activity of these molecules (Arisawa et al., 2008; Wu et al., 2010). Therefore, it remains to be elucidated whether these individuals with genetic polymorphisms are relatively more susceptible to nano-Ag-mediated cytotoxicity and tissue damage.

This find- ing is in strong contrast to the group of DL-PCBs and related potent PCDD/Fs acting via the Ah receptor (AhR). Their affinity or activity parameters related to AhR activation span several orders of magni- tude and comprise compounds with EC50 values in the range of 1 nM (Zeiger et al., 2001). These conclusions demonstrate that the risk assessment approach for receptor-mediated hepatic effects of NDL-PCBs fundamentally differs from that of the group of DL-PCBs. Another conclusion may be that risk assessment data for higher- chlorinated NDL-PCBs such as PCB 153 or 180may be useful as default approach for the whole group of NDL-PCBs, at least for CAR/PXR-driven hepatic effects. Such an approach seems to be conservative including an over-estimation of about ten-fold for the biological potency of the mid- dle or lower chlorinated congeners. The longer elimination half-life of many higher chlorinated NDL-PCBs adds to the safety of such an ap- proach, making assessment of NDL-PCBs based on higher chlorinated NDL-PCBs a worst-case scenario. However, more research is required, in particular to assess possible CAR-independent effects of NDL-PCBs in- cluding metabolic activation of the parent compound, e.g. in the liver, and/or effects in other organs including the immune system and the central nervous system. Furthermore, comparative studies in human hepatocytes are needed. Conflict of interest The authors declare that there are no conflicts of interest.

Zhou et al. / Toxicology and Applied Pharmacology 287 (2015) 1\u20138 toxicity. The expression of miR-374b andmiR-181a following the expo- sure to MC-LR was comparable to the levels in patients with non- obstructive azoospermia or asthenozoospermia, which supports the ep- idemiological evidence on MC-induced reproductive system toxicity. The regulation of the TJ singling bymiRNAmay havewider implications. Indeed, we found that three different miRNAs (miR-374b, miR-615 and miR-362) could regulate the Sertoli cell-Sertoli cell junction pathways (ZO-1, MAPK11 and tubulin) after the exposure to MC-LR according to the experimental results and IPA analysis (Fig. 6). Although further studies are required to determine the function of these altered miRNAs in more detail, our results may aid in understanding the epigenomic regulation of toxicity in Sertoli cells following the exposure to MC-LR and provide evidence based on which the risk assessment of the envi- ronmental toxicity ofMC-LR can bemade. Our studymay provide initial clues enabling further functional characterization of the roles of these miRNAs and their target genes in themale reproductive system toxicity.

Over the past decade, tremendous efforts have been made to develop alternative, non-animal safety tests (Eisenbrand et al., 2002; Hartung, 2009). It is beyond the scope of this review to discuss these tests in detail. These tests include in vitro genetic toxicity tests, skin and eye irritation and corrosion, phototoxicity, skin penetration tests and the LLNA (Local Lymph Node Assay, actually a refinement and reduction animal use and not a replacement test) that are routinely used in the safety evaluation of cosmetic ingredients. However, for pivotal toxicological endpoints, including repeated-dose toxicity, target organ toxicity, toxicokinetics, reproductive toxicity and carcinogenicity, no alternative tests are currently available and none are visible on the horizon. Today, EU Guidelines on the safety evaluation of cosmetic ingredients, such as hair dyes, UV filters, preservatives or hair dyes include a list of mainly in vivo and some in vitro toxicity tests (SCCP, 2006; see II.1). Overall, it is highly unlikely that validated alternative test methods on all toxicological endpoints will be available by 2013 (Hartung, 2009; Pauwels and Rogiers, 2009). In the absence of validated safety tests it appears improbable that international safety regulations, which tend to be conservative and are based on the state of the art of available science will changewithin the coming 4 years. However, huge efforts in these areas are currently ongoing under the EU Framework Programmes 6 and 7, as well as a recent partnership between the EU Commission and Colipa on research in the area of systemic toxicity. In 2011, the European Commission will review the progress and technical difficulties of compliance with the ban of animal testing.

In conclusion, the safety assessment of PCP and their ingredients is a complex topic that is not only affected by scientific questions, but also by the respective regional regulatory status of the product as well as other issues, such as the ethics of animal testing. In the interest of all stakeholders, consumers, regulatory bodies and producers, there is an urgent need for an international harmoniza- tion on how the safety of these products and their ingredients should be evaluated.

Thus, DSF-27 could be a useful pharmacologic tool to deepen our understanding of basic neuroimmune cellular functions. Additional- ly, DSF-27 may also constitute a new class of therapeutic leading compounds for neuroinflammation and neuroimmune axis-related neurodegenerative disorders.

Yokohira et al. / Toxicology and Applied Pharmacology 246 (2010) 1\u20137 2008). We therefore hypothesize that the specific biologic effects of arsenic exposure depend on the toxicokinetic aspects of arsenic metabolism and distribution combined with the sensitivity of the targeted cellular constitutions (probably specific protein sulfhydryl groups) to the various trivalent forms of arsenic. This likely will vary between tissues and between species, as well as inter-individual variation and on conditions of exposure to factors that could influence the toxicokinetic and toxicodynamic aspects of arsenic. Thus, it is likely that the response to exposure to inorganic arsenic is dependent on the exposure of cells to the combination of trivalent arsenicals.

The increase in GDF15 expres- sionmay be a reflection of the levels of oxidative stress in the cellular environment and does not have a pro-angiogenic effect in the hyperoxia model. Also, HIF-1\u03b1 and GDF15 expression were inversely related under normoxic and hyperoxic conditions in H441 cells. These results highlight sex-specific differences in the modulation of molecular pathways in hyperoxic lung injury both in vivo and in vitro, which may correlate with sexual dimorphism in the incidence of BPD.

The authors declare that there are no conflicts of interest. References Discussion Conclusions Declaration of Competing Interest References", "Compliance with ethical standards": "HM10760A has a reduced binding affinity for the receptor relative to EPO, driven mainly by a slower association rate. This slow associa- tion rate might result in more continuous stimulation of EPO receptors. And the slow association rate can contribute to the avoidance of re- ceptor mediated clearance. HM10760A has a novel long-acting me- chanism to avoid vascular endothelium mediated clearance through its FcRn binding properties. In addition, the half-life of HM10760A can be increased by conjugation to PEG. Thus, the development of HM10760A with prolonged survival in the circulation offers the advantage of more convenient dosing and may enhance compliance and clinical efficacy compared with authentic EPO. HM10760A is a highly purified chemical conjugate of rhEPO and HMC001 linked by a non-peptidyl 3.4 kDa PEG linker. rhEPO was produced by transformed CHO cells in a serum-free medium and then purified. In addition, HMC001 was produced by fermentation of transformed Escherichia coli as the inclusion body, followed by succes- sive refolding and purification. The promotion of erythropoiesis by administration of HM10760A can be confirmed by the increase in the level of reticulocytes at first. Although there was a difference by con- centration, after repeated administration of HM10760A, the re- ticulocyte level increased to the highest between 6 days and 2 weeks, and then returned to levels comparable to the controls. In addition, an increase in HCT and Hb was observed along with an increase in re- ticulocyte levels."}},

(2008) have proposed mechanisms for the interaction of metallic NPs with CYP450 enzymes. This suggests competition with the substrate due to the hydrophobicity of the particle and NPs forming micelles with the microsomal membrane, leading to a change in membrane integrity and thus enzyme inactivation. In our view, the CPS particles tested in this study are too large to interact with the catalytic sites of the cytochrome P450 enzymes because the inhibitors and substrates tested have molecular weights of around 300 D and therefore sizes below 1 nm. Membrane perturbation is possible with amphiphilic molecules (surfactants, (Mountfield et al., 2000). CPS particlesmay be considered amphiphilic when suspended in FBS-free solution. When suspended in a solution containing 1%FBS, surface charge decreases from around \u221240 mV to around \u221210 mV, and a decrease in the amphiphilic character is expected. Since CYP450 enzyme activities were inhibited to a similar degree in non FBS- and FBS-containing solutions, the extent to which the amphiphilic character of the particles may contribute to this inhibition is unclear. Inhibition could also be caused by the binding of the particles to the isoenzymes at sites other than the catalytic site. Due to their hydrophobic nature, polystyrene particles can bind to various proteins and the extent and the type of bound protein exhibits size-dependent differences (Lundqvist et al., 2008). Size-dependent binding of particles may cause steric rearrangements facilitating cleavage. Such an effect could lead to better metabolism of the BOMCC substrate by the CYP3A4 isoenzyme in the presence of 200 nm and 500 nm CPS. On the basis of the above findings it is possible to speculate that CYP450 enzymes may also be inhibited by NPs with low toxic potential. This interaction would however only be expected to occur at relatively high intracellular concentrations and to decrease markedly at lower doses. Interference with biotransformation should be considered when screening NPs for toxicity since this may cause drug overdosing or underdosing, with harmful and even life- threatening consequences for patients.

Co-exposure of JB6 P+ cells toWC\u2013Co and the antioxidant, N-acetyl-cysteine, decreased AP-1 activation and phos- phorylation of ERKs, p38kinase, and JNKs suggesting the involvement of ROS in AP-1 and NF-\u03baB activation.

Such decreased Igf-1 may be responsible for the reduced recruitment of Mef2 on the myogenin promoter, thereby decreasing myogenin expression after arsenic exposure. Additionally, arsenic exposure to C2C12 mouse myocyte cells alters histone remodeling status on the myogenin pro- moter surrounding the transcription start site, which may reduce the accessibility of basal transcription factors and repress myogenin ex- pression. Moreover, the nuclear expression of Ezh2, which is known as a negative muscle regulator, was enhanced by arsenic exposure in C2C12 cells. Collectively, we conclude that, rather than acting alone, these altered regulatory mechanisms by arsenic exposure seem to be connected and co-contribute to the repressed myogenin gene in C2C12 cells.

Rainbow trout cells were more sensitive to selenite-induced impairment of cortisol secretion than BT cells, a species-specific sensitivity hierarchy also observed for Se- induced teratogenesis (Holm et al., 2005). Selenite appeared to act at different points in the cortisol steroidogenic pathway in the two species, further highlighting the different responses of closely related species to Se exposure. While the present study did not provide evidence for a role of GSH in Se-induced cortisol impairment, a protective role for SOD was demonstrated in RT cells. The different sensitivities to Se of the two salmonid species suggest that extrapolation of water quality guidelines and threshold values across species should consider species-specific responses. Steroidogenic pathways in wild fish may provide sensitive endpoints for environ- mental assessment and monitoring, in addition to data useful for the protection of biodiversity. Future work will investigate the effect of Se and the role of oxidative stress in adrenocortical cells of other salmonids potentially impacted by Se and coal mining, including brook trout, cutthroat trout, and bull trout.

In contrast with previous exposures to zinc containing PM (Kodavanti et al., 2003, 2008), no cardiac pathology was seen; however, small but significant changes in cardiac mitochondrial SDH activity and ferritin levels, as well as cytosolic GPx changes indicate subtle mitochondrial specific effects. In addition, cardiac gene expression changes were induced, further supporting that pulmonary zinc exposure, even at environmentally relevant concentrations, induces cardiac effects. Changes were small; however may have significant biological and clinical relevance, especially for individuals with pre-existing cardiopulmonary impairments. These results sug- gest that chemical speciation of PM may be important in injury causation, and may therefore need to be taken into account when defining PM regulations.

Therefore, we cannot draw conclusions regarding effectiveness of sulfanegen sodium in treating lethal cyanide poisoning from this study. Animals were anesthetized in compliance with animal welfare regulations; the number of animals studied was limited, as was the duration of follow-up, preventing subtle toxicities from cyanide or sulfanegen sodium from being detected. As this is a sub-lethal model, determining whether similar beneficial effects and complete toxicity reversal will be seen in a higher dose lethal model will also require subsequent investigations. Many of the physiologic changes we monitored during these studies are not specific to cyanide poisoning, and in the face of additional pathologic conditions, may be limited in their capabilities to accurately assess the CN poisoning and reversal. This may be most particularly important in the case of combined cyanide toxicity and carbon monoxide poisoning, which is commonly clinically encountered. Further studies will be needed to define the role in such situations. DOS and CWNIRS measure average tissue constituents to a depth of approximately 4 mm (at the source detector separations used in these studies) (Lee et al., 2007a). Deeper tissue effect and organ specific toxicities cannot be assessed using the current study design. Furthermore, as with all near-infrared optical absorption technolo- gies, other potential optically interfering agents, or medical conditions that might alter blood oxygenation levels could affect the ability to diagnose and monitor cyanide toxicity, including concurrent carbon monoxide and cyanide toxicity states that may be encountered in smoke inhalation victims.", "Acknowledgement": "Acknowledgments The investigators would like to thank Tanya Burney, David Yoon and David Mukai for their input, advice, and guidance in the development of these studies and this manuscript.

The Nrf2 signaling pathway has been reported to confer protection against chemical carcinogens-induced cytotoxicity (Shinkai et al., 2006; William and Thomas, 2008; Du et al., 2008). Here, we confirmed in several cell lines that SFN induced Nrf2 translocation to the nucleus and activated its downstream target genes encoding proteins, such as phase II enzymes NQO1 and HO-1. Induction of NQO1 and HO-1 has been established as a strong cellular defense against oxidative stress (Zhang, 2006). Also, we observed an intracellular GSH level increase after SFN treatment. Since \u03b3-glutamylcysteine synthetase, a phase II enzyme regulated by Nrf2 pathway, is the rate-limiting enzyme in GSH biosynthesis, the GSH level increase may reflect the induction of \u03b3-glutamylcysteine synthetase by SFN (Kong et al., 2001; Brook et al., 2001). Interestingly, SFN-induced antioxidative activities were abolished when Nrf2 was knocked down, indicating a specific role of Nrf2 pathway in SFN- induced cytoprotection against MC-LR. The discovery of the target pathway is significant because it provides a signal that leads to identify compounds with better efficacy. In this study, we found that the cytoprotection induced by SFN is evident at low concentration ranges of below 10 \u03bcM, which is physiologically attainable. Limited Nrf2 accumulation and cytoprotection were observed at high concentrations of SFN (40 \u03bcM for HepG2 cells, 20 \u03bcM for NIH 3 T3 cells), consistent with previous findings that SFN can induce substantial apoptosis in cells at high concentrations (Kong et al., 2001; Kim et al., 2003). Therefore, it is conceivable that lower SFN concentration may achieve optimal Nrf2-mediated antioxidative protection. Our data also show that substantial protection by SFN against MC-LR is time-dependent, and thus it is promising that long term protection against trace amounts of MC-LR in drinking water is achievable by daily consumption of SFN-rich vegetables.

The major finding in this study was that MCF-7/Adr cells showed decrease in cellular GSH concentrations and increase in extracellular GSH concentrations which were attributed to a decreased of the \u03b3-GT activity, an increase in the cellular efflux of GSH and partly to down- regulation of the GSH synthesis enzyme. Consequently, MCF-7/Adr cells were more sensitive to oxidative stress induced by bleomycin andmenadione thanMCF-7 cells. Expression of Hcy-clearing enzymes involved in Hcy methylation and Hcy transsulfuration was up- regulated in MCF-7/Adr cells, suggesting that acquiring doxorubicin- resistance attenuated Met-dependence and activated transsulfuration from Met to Cys. The results of this study suggest that regulating sulfur amino acid metabolismmay be a possible therapeutic target for chemoresistant cancer cells. These results warrant further investiga- tions to determine the role of sulfur amino acid metabolism in acquiring anticancer drug resistance in cancer cells using chemical and biological regulators involved in sulfur amino acid metabolism.

Reference Summary of the workshop on the power of aggregated toxicity data Introduction Presentations Discussion Conclusions Conflict of interest disclosure statement\ufffd Reference", "Funding": "The issue of keeping databases evergreen was raised repeatedly during the panel discussion. It was acknowledged that groups develop new databases with great enthusiasm, but do not commit resources to keeping them up to date; there has to be a way to motivate contributors by providing a benefit to people doing the database input. Some suggestions were reward-based; others suggested enforcement, such as having funding agencies or journals require submitting raw data in a prescribed format for any published article, as is currently donewith gene sequence data. There is also the issue of good laboratory practice (GLP) toxicology studies that have high quality data but may publish their results only as reports rather than sending them to peer-reviewed journals. Another source of data is preliminary studies. A group may collect lethality data for a preliminary pilot study, but only publish results of the main study conducted with some other endpoint. While it should theoretically be possible to harvest high quality data from standar- dized GLP toxicology and drug company studies, data extraction can be complicated by a lack of standardized vocabulary in the reports (the pharmaceutical industry frequently uses nonstandard terminology). Legacy data also represents a potentially valuable resource that presents problems in consistency of terminology. There is a balance between academic freedom and investigative creativity on one hand, and the need to standardize terminology to effectively communicate and combine data from different sources. There are also institutional barriers to efficient database development\u2014 cooperation and funding for enhancements or specific features needed by one agency to a database managed by another agency are problematic. A \u201cWikipedia\u201d model of data input was discussed as a method to encourage broadparticipation indata input. That raises the issue of data quality, although some suggested that the self-correcting nature of Wikipedia entries is something comparable to the established practice of \u201cdouble keying\u201d data. An edited \u201cwiki,\u201d such as Toxipedia (http:// toxipedia.org/), might be a better model. There was general agreement that raw data need to be of high quality for a database to be evergreen, although that is less critical for annotation or metadata-level components of a database. Raw data are also important because it is not always possible to anticipate future needs and all necessary summary elements. It is better to have the underlying data in the database and be able to generate newsummarycontent retrospectively. GenBank (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Genbank/) was mentioned as a recognized example of a database that ensures high quality data. Sequence quality is reinforced by users being able to identify data entry sources and correct errors when they occur (provided the user is familiar with the data and has the expertise to make the change). Access to raw data can be problematic when research groups are unwilling to share material for fear that it could be mined by other groups for publication, or where there are confidentiality issues. Epidemiological data also has personal privacy issues associated with the raw data, often making it impossible to provide the lowest level of disaggregated data. There was some discussion of how to best establish minimum common standards for risk assessment databases. Obviously, it is important to get input from those in various agencies doing risk assessment, but some participants favored more formal mechanisms such as having each agency produce flow charts to identify critical elements, or initiating legislative mandates to sustain ongoing efforts to maintain key data projects. Participants had several examples of valuable databases that have been suffering from loss of sustained funding. What was termed the \u201cpride of ownership problem\u201d makes agencies reluctant to invest their limited resources in databases developed by other agencies. On the other hand, organizations like NLM, which are mandated to bring together information from various agencies, are very motivated to provide support for maintaining particular existing database resources if there are strong positive user evaluations.

The effects appear to be a dynamic interplay between host and microbes because acute exposure did not dramatically perturb the overall tax- onomic composition but did notably increase the cultivable gram- negative facultative anaerobic bacilli grown on MacConkey agar. Since most liver pathologies can be attributed to dysbiosis, the broad correlational analysis between taxa and phenotypic character- istics, while not definitive, certainly implicates the microbiota as causal in TCDD toxicity. This is the first attempt to link TCDD-medi- ated immune dysfunction to dysbiosis, liver toxicity and prediabetes. Further research to determine if induction of liver toxicity by TCDD resulted from microbiome modulation through immunosuppression is warranted.

TGIF can also be recruited by the JNK- induced phosphorylated c-Jun to inhibit CDKN1A expression to antago- nize cell apoptosis (Huang et al., 2006; Liu and Huang, 2006; Liu and Huang, 2008b; Huang et al., 2010). Therefore, it is suggested that both the AKT and the JNK pathways play antagonistic roles in ATO-induced CDKN1A expression and resultant apoptosis. These results indicate that inhibition of the JNK pathway, AKT signaling, or knockdown of TGIF expression can enhance ATO-induced CDKN1A expression and sub- sequent cellular apoptosis in some cancer cells. Although no secondary tumors or skin lesionswere detected in APL patients with long-term ex- posure to ATO (Hu et al., 2009; Emadi and Gore, 2010), we expect that ATO in combination with inhibitors of these negative regulators, or knockdown of TGIFwill be beneficial in advancing the agents' therapeu- tic efficacy.

TNFR1 might have activated caspase-8, and thereby initiated the downstream apoptotic signaling transduction. Considerable crosstalk between the receptor-activated and ERs-apoptotic pathways or mito- chondrial apoptotic pathway might strengthen the apoptotic effect. Fig. 6. Apoptosis rates and mRNA expression levels of TNFR1, caspase-8 and TRADD after TNFR1 optosis rates were determined by FCM assay. A: scattergram of normal cultured chondrocytes chondrocytes incubated with 100 \u03bcg/mL ofloxacin after NC\u2013siRNA treatment. D: scattergram each scattergram, R6 represents normal cells, R4 represents dead cells, and R5 + R7 represen mRNA expressions of TNFR1, caspase-8 and TRADD in chondrocytes after 100 \u03bcg/mL ofloxacin Because of similar chemical structures and characteristics, other QNs may possess similar chondrotoxic mechanisms as ofloxacin does. Thus, the present evidence is important for exploring new approaches during preclinical development and clinical risk evaluation of QNs or for strategies to prevent adverse effects associated with these valuable antimicrobials.

APAP overdose decreased SAMe in whole liver, mitochondria, and 15,000 \u00d7g supernatant at 4 and 6 h, while there is no depression of SAMe levels observed at 2 h. When SAMe was administered following APAP, the levels of SAMe did not decline. SAMe was not detectable in the nucleus at 2 h following APAP treatment even though our level of sensitivity was 12.5 pmol of SAMe. We have also demonstrated here for the first time that administration of NAC following APAP aided in the maintenance of whole cell SAMe levels 4 h after APAP overdose. At both 2 and 4 h following APAP administration, levels of MAT were significantly decreased with respect to the Veh group in the APAP treatment group. MAT activity tended to decrease when SAMe was administered and livers were collected at 2 h following APAP overdose, but no changes were observed at 4 h. These results provide important insight into the effects of APAP overdose on SAMe metabolism in the livers of C57BL/6 mice that can be used in future studies to evaluate alterations in MAT enzymes.

Whether terbinafine and naftifine have beneficial effects on these conditions re- mains to be studied. Among antifungal agents, clotrimazole was report- ed to inhibit GJIC, but it was highly selective for Cx50 (Bodendiek et al., 2012). Since Cx50 expression is restricted to the lens (White et al., 1992), clotrimazole cannot be expected to have these beneficial effects.

Activation of p53 and p21 beginning at 18 h and the subsequent cytochrome c release accompanied with procaspase-3 and PARP cleavage committed cells to final apoptotic cell death. We identified that the toxic effect can also be attained in H1299 cells with ectopic p53, but not those with ectopic mutant p53. Our findings asserted that regulation of cell proliferation by teroxirone in human lung cancer cells depends on the status of p53. The observed antitumor effect strongly suggested that teroxirone provides a feasible and alternative treatment strategy for cancer prevention. Conflict of interest statement None declared.

Moreover, at concentrations that do not affect the phosphorylation capacity of mitochondria and present antioxidant activity, EDX inhibits the MPT. These data suggest that the increased therapeutic benefit obtained from the administration of EDX instead of the prodrug TAM, eliminating the inter-individual variability associ- atedwith TAMmetabolism and avoiding potential serious drug interac- tions, may be accompanied by a significant reduction on mitochondrial toxicity, which is closely related with the hepatotoxicity observed in patients treated with TAM.

The studies on mechanism of action showed that metal complexes of NQTS could stabilize the cleavable complex formed by DNA and topo II. Furthermore, our data suggest that metal derivatives of NQTS have an antagoniz- ing effect on topo II activity although the NQ and NQTS themselves do not have. All these evidence indicate that these metal-NQTS complexes can coordinate with topo II and stabilizing the topo II\u2013DNA complexes and also possibly interact with DNA by forming interhelical cross- links. These multi-inhibition mechanisms would greatly enhance cell cytotoxicity compared to that of NQTS.

It has been demonstrated that activation of nAChRs plays a predominant role in such sensitization (Schoffelmeer et al., 2002), when \u03b17 and \u03b22 subunit- containing nAChRs are involved (Zanetti et al., 2006). Therefore, direct and persistent activation of \u03b17 receptors by MDMA might contribute to its reinforcing effects. To sum up, MDMA activates homomeric \u03b17 nAChR and induces an increase in cytosolic Ca2+. Such an increase is maintained and can activate Ca2+-dependent pathways such as calpain and caspase 3, which are involved in neurotoxicity. In addition, sustained \u03b17 nAChR activation could be responsible for neurochemical changes that result in the psychiatric disorders related with chronic MDMA abuse. Also, MDMA blocks activation of heteromeric nAChRs, which would also contribute to its neurotoxic effects. This work describes and demonstrates a new mechanism of action for MDMA, which was proposed in our previous publications.

This mechanism is metabolite- dependent and involves activation of c-Myb rather than increases in c-Myb protein expression. Given that expo- sure to environmental toxicants, including benzene, has been proposed to be a primary cause for the increase in certain leukemias in developed countries, further elucida- tion of how benzene mediates leukemogenesis is certainly warranted.

It was noted in the Introduction that a significant number of scientists in the pharmaceutical industry, when purchasing liver microsomes or hepatocytes from XenoTech, specify that the donor must be male or, less frequently, female, either because of personal preference or company policy. It could be argued that this information might bias our analysis in favor of the actual conclusion reached, namely, that there is no meaningful basis for restricting purchases of such material to one gender or the other (or for basing purchasing practice on any other variable, such as age or ethnicity). Although we recognize and have tried to avoid such bias, it is perhaps important to point out that the central findings of this study are consis- tent with those reported elsewhere (George et al., 1995b; Hunt et al., 1992; Schmucker et al., 1990; Shimada et al., 1994).

Our previous study found that CO, a byproduct of HO-1, inhibited TPA-induced ERK/AP-1 activation in breast cancer (Lin et al., 2008a). We herein found that treatment with CO-releasing compound, RuCO, or induction of HO-1 by the chem- ical inducers CoPP and FePP decreased HSP90 client protein expression, tumor proliferation, or tumor invasion. Induction of wt-p53 elicited by CO was diminished in the presence of SnPP (Fig. 4B). SnPP is an HO-1 enzymatic inhibitor which blocks the production of HO-1 byproduct whereas it has no effect on HO-1 protein expression. Moreover, pre- treatment with CO scavenger, Hb, significantly abolished CO-mediated growth inhibition whereas it showed slight prevention in FePP-treated cells (Fig. 1C). Treatment with RuCO not only induces the release of CO directly but also induces HO-1 protein expression, and the expres- sion of HO-1 further promotes CO production. This reciprocal regulation may augment the effects of CO on HSP90 attenuation and growth inhi- bition. In contrast, FePP induced the production of HO-1 byproducts such as bilirubin, biliverdin, and ferric ions which might also have the capability to inhibit tumor growth. In addition, previous study reported that FePP-mediated cytotoxicity might be independent of HO-1 induc- tion (Chow et al., 2008), suggesting that the preventive effect by Hb is limited in FePP-treated cells and that CO plays an important role in inhibition of tumor growth and HSP90.We also assessed other products of HO-1 including biliverdin, bilirubin, and ferric ions, and results showed that biliverdin and bilirubin effectively inhibited the growth of MCF7 cells (Supplemental Fig. S1A). However, neither bilirubin nor ferric ions had the ability to suppress HSP90 client protein expression (Supplemental Fig. S1B). However, the expression of cyclinD1 was suppressed in the presence of bilirubin and ferric ions. Bilirubin and biliverdin have been reported to be potent antioxidants, suggesting that their growth inhibition may be mediated through other mecha- nism instead of HSP90 inhibition. These data confirmed that CO plays amajor role inmodulation ofHSP90. Additionally, COhas been reported with the ability to modulate the activity of several enzymes such as MMP-9 (Lin et al., 2008a), inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) (Kim et al., 2008), and NOX1 (Rodriguez et al., 2010). The detail inhibitory mechanism, however, is yet to be clarified. In addition, curcumin was reported to be an inhibitor of AP-1 (Lin et al., 2010) and an inducer of HO-1 (Lima et al., 2011). Moreover, a recent study showed that curcumin disrupts the association between HSP90 and the telomerase subunit, hTERT (Lee and Chung, 2010), and sensitizes HDAC inhibitor- induced apoptosis by depleting HSP90 client proteins (EGFR, Akt, Raf-1, and survivin) (Giommarelli et al., 2010; Lee and Chung, 2010). These client proteins participate in not only tumor growth but also tumor invasiveness. Curcumin has been reported with many antitumor activities except the induction of HO-1. In the present study, the induc- tion of HO-1 by RuCO and curcumin possessed the ability to attenuate HSP90 and its client proteins. We propose that curcumin might, at least in part, induce HO-1 activation to elicit CO production, which further attenuates HSP90 protein activity and therefore inhibits tumor malignancy. Taken together, we showed that induction of HO-1 by chemopreventive compounds provides a new therapeutic perspective through HO-1/CO-mediated HSP90 inhibition.

Activation of the Ras/ERK1/2 pathway led to upregulation of Cdc25c, whereas activation of the Ras/ERK path- way was related to an increase in cdk1 activity and increases in the phosphorylation of Cdc25c.

This finding should be considered during the use of MB in humans and animals. Furthermore, the observation that azure B is a mixed AChE/BuChE inhibitor further enhances the potential contribution of this metabolite to the beneficial effects of MB in Alzheimer's disease.

Uncertainty on display", "Acknowledgement": "The science charade was not invented in the 20th century. It has been played many times before. The means of ending the charade has also been well understood for centuries. For example, Blaise Pascal was concerned with a 16th century form of the science charade known as \u201cprobabilism\u201d, where the moral and factual suitability of a church decision was considered to be entirely a matter of 197C.D. Carrington, P.M. Bolger / Toxicology and Applied Pharmacology 243 (2010) 191\u2013197 authoritative opinion (Daston, 1988). Pascal's solution to probabilism was essentially the same solution prescribed by the NAS risk assessment/management report (NRC, 1983, 1994), and the same solution acknowledged in the 1996 EPA Cancer guidelines: formal acknowledgement of uncertainty (US EPA, 1996). It may be that the logical tools or formal expressions of uncertainty have yet to be developed, and what constitutes a convincing scientific argument may be left as a matter of scientific judgment or opinion. But, the precise mechanisms used to represent uncertainty aside, the act of arguing the evidence serves to insulate the scientific discussion from the political determination of objectives. Or, to put it another way, an uncertainty analysis may be used as a tool to wrest the benefit of the doubt from those who are exploiting a source of uncertainty. The widely held notion that science produces facts that are utterly certain may be at least partly attributed to policies masquerading as scientific arguments. For example, in contemplating Senator Muskie's call for one-armed scientists, David (1975) wrote:"}},

Moreover, these data could be translated to a newly established in vivo zebrafish model for Cu intoxication. Our results show that OSIP108 could be a new candidate for treatment ofWD. For practical applications in e.g.WD, the bioavailability andefficacyof theOSIP108 peptide have to be determined in different organs, including the liver and brain, for in- stance by oral and intravenous administration of OSIP108 in rodent models for WD (Mori et al., 1994; Theophilos et al., 1996).

References", "Acknowledgement": "In conclusion, it can be stated that by forming a thiol-reactive quinone, the antioxidant quercetin can shift oxidant damage in a cell from DNA damage towards thiol arylation. This quercetin paradox, i.e. the flavonoid becomes toxic as a result of its protection, is depicted in Fig. 5. Such a paradoxmight also apply for other free radical scavenging antioxidants, as is recently also suggested by Bjelakovic et al. (2007). Their meta-analysis of 68 randomized trials, in which the effect of antioxidant supple- mentation in adults was investigated, shows that treatment with the antioxidants \u03b2-carotene, vitamin A and/or vitamin E may increase mortality. A possible explanation for this finding could be the formation of toxic antioxidant metabolites during the scavenging activities of these antioxidants, i.e. a paradox similar to the one described for quercetin. In other words, the toxicity of such antioxidant metabolites might shade or even eclipse the direct positive effects of antioxidant supplementation. Hypo- thetically, protection by selective cell death of cells exposed to high levels of oxidative stress might be the definite paradox of the beneficial effects of quercetin.

Our data strongly support the hypothesis that renal P450-mediated metabolic activation plays an important role in renal toxicity induced by chloroform. This is the first direct in vivo evidence to demonstrate the essential role of renal P450s in nephrotoxicity induced by chemi- cal compounds, which could promote future studies on novel ap- proaches for the prevention and intervention of chemical-induced renal injury. Our results also demonstrate the usefulness of the two novel mouse models for studying kidney toxicity induced by chemical compounds.

Our data show that Ned D Heindel 4338 improves wound repair following SM-induced skin injury. Wound repair was evident by the reduction of skin edema, enhanced skin re-epithelialization, a fully differentiated epidermis, and a well-structured basement membrane zone following Ned D Heindel 4338 treatment of SM wounded skin. This was associated with reduced expression of COX2 and MMP9. Additional studies will help to further characterize the anti-inflammatory mecha- nism of action of Ned D Heindel 4338 and its effects on wound repair in the SM induced skin injury model.

Expression change (ratio to controls) in genes related to cell cycle/proliferation (Cc n = 5/group. regulation in the longer-term in vivo study (Zhang et al., 2011) is consis- tent with the pattern of gene changes between 1 and 4 weeks of expo- sure in our study. The present results support a nonlinear mode of action for the carci- nogenicity of Ni3S2, and the utilization of a nonlinear approach in risk assessment for this compound rather than the default linear dose\u2013 response option for carcinogens. In future studies, it would be interest- ing to compare the gene expression profile for Ni3S2with that of another nickel compound that was not carcinogenic in rats (e.g., Ni sulfate hexa- hydrate, Dunnick et al., 1995), to see if differences in mode of action for these two compounds can be assessed, when equivalent lung Ni con- centrations are compared. The availability of in vivo gene expression data for Ni3S2 also provides an opportunity to evaluate the potential for in vitro studies of the genomic responses of the lung epithelial cells to serve as a surrogate for in vivo exposure. The development of such an in vitro alternative, particularly when conducted in an air\u2013liquid interface setting, would be highly valuable for comparisons of mode of action and potency across different nickel compounds and between rats and humans. In summary, the genomic response of the distal lung airway epithe- lium of the rat to inhalation of Ni3S2 for up to 4 weeks is consistentwith a nickel mode of action involving relatively non-specific disruption of cellular function. An initial adaptive survival response after 1 week of exposure appears to transition to inflammation and proliferation on longer exposure to higher concentrations. This inflammatory and proliferative signaling, if maintained, could lead to mis-replication and eventual tumors. Conflict of interest There is no conflict of interest.

All animals used for this studywere housed in sterilized cages in a facility with a 12-h night/day cycle. Temperature and relative humidity were held at 22\u00b12 \u00b0C and 50\u00b15%, respectively. The UNC Division of Laboratory Animal Medicine maintains these animal facilities, and veterinarians were always available to ensure animal health. All animals were given humane care in compliance with NIH and institutional guidelines and studies were performed according to protocols approved by the appropriate institutional review board. Prior to experiments, animals were maintained on standard lab chow diet and purified water ad libitum. WY-14,643 was obtained from Aldrich (Milwaukee, WI). Acute doses were administered by a single oral gavage of 0 (control), 5 or 50 mg/kg of WY-14,643 in olive oil.Mice (n=3) were sacrificed 8 h, 24 h or 72 h post dosing. Sub-chronic doses of WY-14,643 were administered in the diet ad libitum. NIH-07 was used as the base for the powdered diet containing either 0 (control), 50 or 500 ppm of WY-14,643.Mice (n=3) were sacrificed after either 1 week or 4 weeks of dietary treatment. Animals had free access to water throughout the study and the health status of the animals was monitored every other day. At sacrifice, mice were anesthetized with pentobarbital (100 mg/kg) and following exsanguination livers were removed and weighed. A section from the left lateral lobe was fixed in 10% formalin. The remaining tissue was snap frozen in liquid nitrogen. The samples were stored at \u221280 \u00b0C until assayed. RNA isolation. While frozen, a small fragment (approximately 30 mg) was removed for each liver sample and homogenized for 30 s in 600 \u03bcl RLT buffer (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) containing 1% \u03b2-mercaptoethanol. The lysate was centrifuged for 3 min at 13000 rpm. From the resulting supernatant, total RNA was isolated using an RNeasy kit (Qiagen) as per the manufacturer's protocol. Total RNA integrity and quantification were assessed using RNA 6000 nano assay LabChips\u00ae (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA) and analyzed on a 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies) as per the manufacturer's protocol."}},

These processes of DMA(V) disposition occurred rapidly. DMA(V) was metabolized to DMA(III), TMAO, DMTA and TMAS, all of which were detected in urine. DMA(III) was metabolized to TMAO, DMTA and TMAS, which were also detected in urine. Parent compound (DMA(V) and DMA(III)) was also detected in urine, indicating these arsenicals are not completely metabolized but are also mobilized for excretion. Administered dose also affected the metabolism of DMA(V), as a lower percentage of the dose was metabolized in the high dose group. The lower absorption and metabolism of high doses of DMA(V) as well as its rapid excretion may partly explain the low acute toxicity of this organic arsenical.

While Tl(I) mainly stimulates mitochondrial destabilization and triggers the classic mitochondrial pathway of apoptosis and caspase-independent cell death, Tl(III) has a more complex behaviour. This cation, in addition to the stimulation of mitochondrial-dependent apoptosis, induced cells death by the extrinsic pathway. In vitro, Tl(III) binds to transferrin (Harris and Messori, 2002) and thus it could potentially reach cell interior following Fe uptake. If true, Tl(III) could accumulate within lysosomes and promote their destabilization and rupture, causing the release of hydrolytic enzymes, such as cathepsins, able to trigger cell apoptosis. This hypothesis and its relationship with results presented in this work are actually under investigation, and will contribute to unravel the mechanisms underlying Tl toxicity.

The largest number of DEGs in the maternal and fetal brain was observed in the 10 mg/kg dose group and this dose also had the higher impact on biological processes found to be enriched across CP doses. However, sub-anticholinesterasic doses of CP were also shown to impact maternal and fetal brain. In the maternal brain, the dose of 4 mg/kg influenced GO categories and pathways such as cell adhesion, behavior, lipid metabolism, long-term potentiation, nervous system development, neurogenesis, secretory pathway, synaptic transmis- sion. In the fetal brain, which was greatly impacted by CP exposure, sub-anticholinesterasic doses of CP (2 and/or 4 mg/kg) altered cell division, translation, transmission of nerve impulse, chromatin modification, long-term potentiation. In addition, some genes involved in nervous system development and signaling were shown to be specifically influenced by these lower CP doses. Our approach was sensitive to reflect the diversity of effects induced by CP and retrieved the enrichment of GO categories and pathways terms known to be disrupted by CP. Moreover, it highlighted additional consequences of CP neurotoxicity, such as disturbance of the ubiquitin proteasome system. In the future, additional kinetic and temporal analysis of AChE effects will be phenotypically linked with our omic analysis.

While oral administration does attenuate AA bioavail- ability somewhat, the concomitant increase in the internal exposure to GA makes this decrease less important for genotoxic effects that result from GA. In addition, the apparent relative increase in GA formation as dose is reduced suggests that exposure to very low doses of AA in foods should be more efficient in forming GA. This dose consideration will take on added significance when geno- toxic effects observed in experimental animals at high doses are used to estimate human risks from consumption of AA at low levels in the diet. The GA formed from metabolism of AA is widely distributed to tissues and DNA adduct formation is observed in many organs, including putative sites for tumor formation in the mouse. These findings provide strong support for a genotoxic mechanism of AA carcinogenicity observed in rodent bioassays, making its potency a critical factor in assessing risks to humans from pervasive low level exposure through the diet.

Conclusion Based on the above findings and under the conditions of this study, it is concluded that single oral administration of MEAI to rats, at a dose level of 10 mg/kg was well tolerated. Furthermore, in the five-day oral administration of MEAI to rats at a dose level of 30 mg/kg, it was well tolerated and did not cause any significant adverse clinical effects nor histopathological, hematological or serumbiochemical changes as com- pared to vehicle treatment. In the cytotoxicity test, cell viability was not affected in both rat brain striatumprimary neurons and human primary hepatocytes using up to 100 mg/L MEAI. Cytotoxic effect was demon- strated using concentrations of 500 and 1000 mg/L with a calculated IC50 value of 368.2 mg/L for rat brain striatum primary neurons and 403.1 mg/L for human primary healthy hepatocytes. The combination of 6% or 7.5% ethanol with 100 mg/L MEAI revealed no statistically sig- nificant increase in cytotoxic effect. In the bacterial mutagenicity test, MEAI in the absence of metabolic activation was considered as not mu- tagenic. However, in the presence of metabolic activation, MEAI re- vealed a slight mutagenic activity only at the highest dose (5 mg/ plate) and only in one S. typhimurium strain out of five. In conclusion,MEAI showed a good safety profile at 10 and 30mg/kg in rats, corresponding to the human doses of 1.6 mg/kg and 4.8 mg/kg, respectively. Further studies, especially long term chronic and behavior studies in rodents and non-rodent species, are required in-order to as- sess MEAI safety profile adequately, before a human trial can be commenced.

Conclusion Based on the above findings and under the conditions of this study, it is concluded that single oral administration of MEAI to rats, at a dose level of 10 mg/kg was well tolerated. Furthermore, in the five-day oral administration of MEAI to rats at a dose level of 30 mg/kg, it was well tolerated and did not cause any significant adverse clinical effects nor histopathological, hematological or serumbiochemical changes as com- pared to vehicle treatment. In the cytotoxicity test, cell viability was not affected in both rat brain striatumprimary neurons and human primary hepatocytes using up to 100 mg/L MEAI. Cytotoxic effect was demon- strated using concentrations of 500 and 1000 mg/L with a calculated IC50 value of 368.2 mg/L for rat brain striatum primary neurons and 403.1 mg/L for human primary healthy hepatocytes. The combination of 6% or 7.5% ethanol with 100 mg/L MEAI revealed no statistically sig- nificant increase in cytotoxic effect. In the bacterial mutagenicity test, MEAI in the absence of metabolic activation was considered as not mu- tagenic. However, in the presence of metabolic activation, MEAI re- vealed a slight mutagenic activity only at the highest dose (5 mg/ plate) and only in one S. typhimurium strain out of five. In conclusion,MEAI showed a good safety profile at 10 and 30mg/kg in rats, corresponding to the human doses of 1.6 mg/kg and 4.8 mg/kg, respectively. Further studies, especially long term chronic and behavior studies in rodents and non-rodent species, are required in-order to as- sess MEAI safety profile adequately, before a human trial can be commenced.

Several studies have shown a link between prostaglandin production and the initiation and progression of skin carcinogenesis (Fischer et al., 1999; Wilgus et al., 2003; Chun et al., 2007). Our studies demonstrate that UVB also stimulates a number of additional synthases important in prostaglandin produc- tion, as well as prostaglandin receptors and each may be critical for mediating the biological effects of UVB in mouse skin (see Fig. 11 for summary of prostaglandin synthase and prostaglandin receptor genes upregulated by UVB and those regulated byMAP kinases and/or PI3K). Whether or not the genes induced by UVB contribute to its biological actions will depend on levels of expression of functional proteins for the prostaglandin synthases and receptors as well as amounts of prostaglandins produced in keratinocytes. Further studies are needed to more clearly define the prostaglandins produced by keratinocytes and their roles in modulating the responses of the skin to UVB.

With greater use of appropriate animal models, particularly with transgenic animals and various chronic or sub-chronic in vivo approaches using inorganic or organic arsenic metabolites, a better under- standing of the adverse effects should be achieved. A major question that remains to be answered is what is the level of risk for cancer with human arsenic exposure, particularly in the low-exposure range of 0 to approximately 200 ppm arsenic. A definitive understanding of the various mecha- nisms of arsenic action in experimental animal models will both provide useful data and assist model selection and development in arsenic risk assessment.

Trivalent methylated arsenic species are more membrane-permeable than pentavalent or inorganic arsenic compounds and are taken up by CHO cells to a higher degree from the external medium. The induction of genotoxic effects caused by methylated arsenic species depends fundamentally upon their ability to penetrate cell membranes. Further studies are needed to assess the intracellular speciation after incubation with respective arsenic compounds in mammalian cells.

The positive correlation between the urinary arsenic levels and porphyrin concen- trations has demonstrated the effect of arsenic on the heme biosynthetic pathway leading to alteration of the porphyrin profile. Porphyrins were higher in arsenic-exposed individ- uals in the three age groups compared to those of control groups (b20, 20\u201340 and N40 years). The results suggest that women, children and old age people who spend more time indoor would have higher exposure to arsenic, leading to greater increases in porphyrin concentrations and hence are likely to be the susceptible populations of higher risk in this region. Significant increases in uroporphyrin and coproporphyrin III in the younger age exposed group suggest that these porphyrins are potential early warning biomarkers for chronic arsenic exposure. Whether the change of porphyrin profile can be used as a warning sign for the onset of arsenic-induced carcinogenesis requires further investigation.

Whereas, UA attenuates DA-induced mitochondrial dysfunction and cognitive deficits in mice via the regulation of Akt and FoxO1 pathways. These results indicate that UA could be recommended as a possible candidate for the prevention and therapy of cognitive deficits in excitotoxic brain disorders. A diagram of the neuroprotective effects of UA against DA-induced cognitive deficits is shown in Fig. 7. Conflict of interest No conflict of interest is declared.

Reduction in fish TSH\u03b2 expression following either T4 or T3 treatment has been documented by previous studies (Lema et al., 2009; MacKenzie et al., 2009; Raldua and Babin, 2009; Carr and Patino, 2011). These observations indicate that similar feedback regulation of TSH\u03b2 expression in the mammalian model also exists in teleosts. Additionally, our results demonstrate that the expression of EGFP within the pituitary primordia of TSH\u03b2: EGFP transgenic zebrafish is similar to that of endogenous TSH\u03b2 levels in wild-type zebrafish (Fig. 4). Goitrogens are substances that cause an enlargement of the thyroid via various mechanisms. PTuracil can reduce TH synthesis by inhibiting thyroperoxidase activity. KClO4 is also able to reduce TH synthesis via impairing iodide uptake (Raldua and Babin, 2009). In order to achieve an adequate secretion of THs, the adaptive processes are triggered and maintained by increased expression and secretion of TSH. The levels of EGFP expression in the transgenic reporter fish were highly associated with endogenous TSH\u03b2 transcript levels. Considering the signal cascade for hormone regulation within the HPT system (Fig. 6), the expression of anterior pituitary EGFP in our reporter zebrafish exhibited appropriate responsiveness to treat- ment with these goitrogens and THs. Based on these results, measuring anterior pituitary EGFP expression driven by the TSH\u03b2 promoter as a reflection of the endogenous TSH\u03b2mRNAexpression domain in anterior pituitary thyrotrope cells may be a useful and unique in vivo system for the detection of chemicals that may potentially affect critical signals along the HPT cascade.

High numbers of replicates (n = 9) imply a good level of trust in the resulting data, and have been confirmed by Q-PCR. New methods have been developed for successful analysis of macroarray data. The t test is a well-established, conventional method with recognised statistical significance. The standard deviation method is good for analysing groups of data. It can also be used to compare individual unknown samples against an established control range, which may be more practical in industrial/medical scenarios.

This modeling approach allows the prediction of the magnitude of the toxi- cokinetic interactions in mixtures of varying complexity and composition and in each case permits the prediction of the extent of change in the tissue dose or kinetics of the toxic moiety. The use of this information along with the \u201ctissue\u2013 dose vs tissue\u2013response\u201d relationship for each component should facilitate the conduct of a toxicokinetic interaction- based risk assessment for mixtures.

Joshi et al. / Toxicology and Applied Pharmacology 328 (2017) 54\u201359 past decade (De Meyer et al., 2012). These inhibitors include monoclo- nal antibodies against VWF andDNA aptamers that act like chemical an- tibodies by binding to VWF with high affinity. Preclinical and clinical studies have already demonstrated the antithrombotic potential of such inhibitors (reviewed in (De Meyer et al., 2012). Moreover, clinical testing in animal models and healthy individuals points towards a pro- foundly lower bleeding risk with equal or even higher efficacy as com- pared to established anti-platelet drugs (Kageyama et al., 1997; Kageyama et al., 2002; Ulrichts et al., 2011). Our results indicate that VWF directly contributes to liver fibrosis. Thus, targeting VWF function- ality with these monoclonal antibodies or DNA aptamers could there- fore be a novel therapeutic approach in the treatment of chronic liver disease. In summary, we report that VWF deficiency significantly attenuates the cellular profibrogenic response and fibrosis in experimental chronic liver injury. The results solidify the role of VWF as a causal factor in liver fibrosis, building on strong clinical evidence of an association between elevated VWF levels with cirrhosis. Additional mechanistic studies de- fining the mechanism whereby VWF exacerbates experimental fibrosis are likely to reveal novel links between the hemostatic system and cir- rhosis. Such studies have thepotential to identify specific VWF functions as putative therapeutic targets for liver cirrhosis.

Thus, there has been much focus on the possible roles of lipid peroxidation- derived aldehydes in contributing to various liver diseases including hepatitis and cancer. Among such aldehydes, 4-HNE has become the most studied product of lipid peroxidation (Spiteller et al., 2001). The physiological concentration of 4-HNE in the plasma is reportedly from 0.3 to 0.7 \u03bcM (Esterbauer et al., 1991; Strohmaier et al., 1995), but its concentration can reach as high 10 \u03bcM or more in plasma membrane under conditions of oxidative stress (Schwarzer et al., 1996; Uchida, 2003). Recently, the two-electron cousin of 4-HNE, 4-ONE, has come under scrutiny with the discovery that it is a product of lipid peroxidation in its own right (Lee and Blair, 2000; Spiteller et al., 2001). It has been reported that 4-ONE in vivo is produced either at similar levels as 4-HNE (Lee and Blair, 2000) or at lower levels than 4- HNE (Kuiper et al., 2008, 2010). Therefore, the pathophysiological significance of the present finding that, up to 20 \u03bcM, 4-ONE, but not 4- HNE, induces hepatocyte cell death in vitro has to wait further experiments. However, the present study indicates that 4-ONE has the potential to induce liver cell death via XO-derived ROS generation. Further, it seems possible to speculate the following harmful chain reaction: initiation of lipid peroxidation by certain irritants or oxidants \u2013 formation of 4-ONE \u2013 XD/XO interconversion by 4-ONE \u2013 further progression of lipid peroxidation by the XO-derived ROS.

Our findings suggest that CAR activation increases cMyc level through repression of miR-122 by competing with HNF4\u03b1 for binding to the DR1 motif in pri-miR-122 promoter and up-regulation of miR-122 direct target E2f1 in mouse livers (Fig. 5). However, we have to acknowledge that, al- though our results are consistent with the key role of HNF4a\u2013CAR cross-talk in the repression of miR-122 and up-regulation of E2f1 and cMyc thatwasmeasured in thiswork, the definitive experiments should be performed using ectopic expression, knock-down studies and lucif- erase reporter assays. A detailed understanding of HNF4a\u2013CAR cross- talk will provide new opportunities for developing more effective ther- apeutic approaches to treat liver diseases.

Preincubation with zinc protected against H2O2 toxicity in gill cells but incubation with zinc plus H2O2 at the same time increased H2O2 toxicity in gill cells. We suggest zinc protection is due to production of antioxidant proteins, such as MT, G6PD and GST. The presence of multiple MRE motifs in the 5V regulatory regions of these and many other antioxidant genes suggests a basic function of zinc to activate defense mechanisms against ROS. Our finding that induction of MT, G6PD, and GST in response to H2O2 is a zinc-dependent process suggests that this function might be a signal for oxidative stress. Thus, during exposure to H2O2, zinc is being released from MT and other zinc proteins (Zhang et al., 2003) and the increase in cytoplasmic concentration of weakly ligated Zn(II) initiates transcription of antioxidant genes through MTF-1 and perhaps alternative pathways. Thus, zinc had a direct pro- oxidant effect and indirect antioxidant effect in this model, perhaps through the induction of MT and antioxidant enzyme activity in the gill cell.

Saito et al. / Toxicology and Applied Pharmacology 246 (2010) 8\u201317 overdose (Fig. 10). Both GSH depletion and an oxidant stress are required for JNK activation, which seems to control at least in part the early release of intermembrane proteins and DNA fragmentation throughmitochondrial Bax translocation. However, themost important effect of JNK inhibition was a profound suppression of peroxynitrite formation, which was not caused by inhibition of iNOS induction. In contrast, there was clearly a complete elimination of the mitochondrial oxidant stress suggesting an effect of JNK activation on mitochondrial ROS formation. Although the exact target of JNK in themitochondria has to be identified, it appears to be upstream of the MPT. Because of the critical role of oxidant stress andperoxynitrite for thepropagationof cell injury, especially mitochondrial viability, these data demonstrate that JNK could be an important target to limit cell injury and liver failure, at least during the first 24 h after APAP overdose.
