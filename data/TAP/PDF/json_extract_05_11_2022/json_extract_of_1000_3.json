Sunil et al. / Toxicology and Applied Pharmacology 250 (2011) 10\u201318 Methacholine is a potent bronchoconstrictor used in animal models to examine hyper-responsiveness of the airway, and to assess airway wall stiffness and parenchymal elasticity (Bates and Lauzon, 2007). In accord with previous findings (Nagase et al., 1994), the present studies show a marked increase in total lung resistance and a decrease in compliance in response to methacholine in control rats. These changeswere accompanied by disproportionate increases in both tissue damping and elastance, resulting in an increase in eta. Under homeostatic conditions, the lung behaves in a homogeneous fashion, despite its structural complexity (Bates and Lutchen, 2005; Bates and Suki, 2008). The rise in eta, in response to methacholine, indicates an increase in lung heterogeneity with concomitant airway restriction. This may result from regional differences in elasticity within the lung, which become apparent under conditions of stress induced by methacholine challenge. The most remarkable functional alteration noted following nitrogen mustard exposure was a reduction in metha- choline-induced increases in total lung resistance, with nomajor effects on lung compliance. This blunting of lung resistance in response to methacholine can best be explained by a loss of active airway tone. Whether this results from a loss of smooth muscle function or a failure of sympathetic control cannot be ascertained from these data. A significant blunting of methacholine-induced increases in tissue damping and elastance were also noted in nitrogen mustard-treated animals. The reduced responses in tissue damping, elastance, and eta most likely result from the inability of the airways to respond actively to the bronchoconstrictive agent. It is important to note that the loss of compliance in lungs from control and nitrogen mustard-treated rats is, for the most part similar, despite the reduced constriction in vesicant-injured animals. This may be explained by parenchymal injury and an accumulation of inflammatory mediators in the lower lung, which results in a reduced static elastic recoil. These observations are consistent with both our histological observations, and baseline lung function data. In summary, the present studies demonstrate that exposure of rats to nitrogen mustard results in significant histological changes and increases in BAL protein and inflammatory cells, along with increases in expression of pro-inflammatory and pro-fibrotic proteins. These changes are directly associated with altered lung mechanics and function. These studies are novel and provide support for pulmonary function assessment in understanding the adverse effects of vesicants such as nitrogen mustard on the respiratory system. Results from these studies may lead to the development of efficacious treatments for nitrogen mustard-induced pulmonary injury.", "Acknowledgement": "Acknowledgments The authors wish to thank Sherritta Ridgely, D.V.M., Ph.D., for histological evaluation of H&E-stained sections.

Surprisingly, TCDD-treated BMDCs generated normal antigen-specific T cell responses in vivo. These results were unexpected, as TCDD not only induced a regulatory phenotype in BMDCs, but also increased their expression of several regulatory mediators including IDO1, IDO2 and TGF-\u03b23. Several possibilities could account for the lack of T cell suppression by TCDD-treated BMDCs. Though our results demonstrated that TCDD alters antigen uptake of ovalbumin by BMDCs, it is possible that the observed decreases in antigen uptake do not reach a physiological threshold below which T cell activation is affected. Additionally, TCDD may increase the expression, but not the function or activity of the suppressive mediators IDO1, IDO2 and TGF-\u03b23. In this case, we would not expect TCDD-treated BMDCs to contribute to the suppression of T cell activation. Recent studies have linked AhR activation in DCs with suppression of T cell responses (Hauben et al., 2008). In these studies, AhR-activated BMDCs suppressed T cell responses only following LPS stimulation; immature BMDCs did not alter T cell responses. Thus, we also evaluated the expression of the suppressive mediators in BMDCs following LPS activation. TCDD-treated BMDCs stimulated with LPS displayed increased expression of IDO1, IDO2, TGF-\u03b21, TGF-\u03b22 and Thbs1. However, future experiments are needed to determine whether TCDD-treated BMDCs stimulated with LPS can affect antigen-specific T cell responses. Collectively, we show that AhR activation alters inflammatory DC differentiation, generating DCs that are hyperresponsive to TLR stimulation and exhibit a regulatory phenotype in vitro. Surprisingly, these BMDCs fail to alter antigen-specific T cell activation. However, further studies are needed to examine the potential for AhR-activated DCs to contribute to the generation of regulatory T cells and the suppression of T cell-mediated immune responses. One of the novelties of our data is the identification of biomarkers of exposure to TCDD and TCDD-like chemicals on a highly sensitive and extremely important immune cell population, the inflammatory DCs. Moreover, these effects were detected at very low, environmentally relevant levels of exposure. Because our results indicate that specific modulation occurs in these cells, it would be of great value to evaluate human inflammatory DCs. Similarly, our data further define mechanisms of action of TCDD on the immune system. This information may be useful for the generation of focused therapeutic approaches to treat humans exposed to environmental chemicals that can activate the AhR. Furthermore, it highlights the potential to develop selective AhR modulators that may be beneficial in the treatment of allergies and autoimmune diseases.

RhoB expression, however, significantly inhibited the proliferation, migration and invasion of the gastric can- cer cells and also enhanced the chemosensitivity of these cells to anticancer drugs. It appears that RhoB plays an opposing role from that of RhoA and/or RhoC in gastric cancer cells (Zhou et al., 2011). In the nude mice model, we indeed observed RhoB overexpression in the tumors which was fed with GA solution (Fig. 7D). In addition, RhoB overexpression tumors were smaller than the positive group (Figs. 7A and B). Our work suggests a negative role of RhoB in gastric cancer progression and GA might be a potential agent for gastric cancer therapy.

NF-\u03baB is crucial for regulating many critical biological processes in- cluding cell apoptosis and immune response. We wondered whether gastrodin upregulates NF-\u03baB activity in CD4+ T cells according to the following two considerations. First, NF-\u03baB represses cell apoptosis through inducing the transcription of various anti-apoptotic genes such as Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL (Baldwin, 2012). These proteins belong to Bcl-2 protein family which protects cell from mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization, cytochrome c release, caspase-9 activa- tion and subsequent cell demolition (Llambi and Green, 2011). Ex- pression level of Bcl-2 has been demonstrated to be a pivot factor controlling CD4+ T cell survival (Shi et al., 2007). Moreover, in our system, the caspase-9 activity in CD4+ T cells was repressed after gastrodin treatment. Second, it has been well established that NF-\u03baB is able to promote IFN-\u03b3 and IL-2 gene transcription which modulates immune response (Gerondakis et al., 1998; Weil and Israel, 2004). We found that gastrodin upregulated serum levels of IFN-\u03b3 and IL-2. To evaluate effects of gastrodin administration on the activity of NF-\u03baB pathway, we firstly determined the effects of gastrodin on transcription levels of NF-\u03baB responsive genes including Bcl-2, Bcl-xL and IL-2. The data showed that injecting gastrodin upregulated their transcription levels in CD4+ T cells of the tumor-bearing mice. Interestingly, gastrodin did not affect their transcription in CD8+ T cells. These observations suggested that gastrodin upregulates NF-\u03baB activity selectively in CD4+ T cells. The unique gene expres- sion pattern including surface receptors in CD4+ T cells might con- tribute to the cell-type specificity of gastrodin, although the detailed molecular mechanisms deserve further investigation. Consistently, our ChIP assay revealed that gastrodin administration increased the interaction between NF-\u03baB p65 subunit and the promoter regions of Bcl-2 and IL-2 encoding genes in CD4+ T cells. This observation fur- ther confirmed the NF-\u03baB-activating capacity of gastrodin which pro- vide potential molecular mechanisms underlying its immune stimulation effect. Collectively, our current investigations provide sci- entific basis for the traditional application of the restorative food G. elata against HCC. In addition, our data also support considering gastrodin as a potential adjuvant reagent to stimulate anticancer im- mune response in clinical HCC treatment.

It is worth noting that SREBPs are normally expressed at a low level in lung cells that require lipogenesis to maintain surfactant. Deregulation of lipogenesis has been reported to cause lung damage (Besnard et al. 2009; Plantier et al. 2012). In addition, BEAS-2B cells may provide a better represen- tation of the in vivo airway epithelial when they are cultured in vitro at the air\u2013liquid interface. It is not clear whether the results from our study represented the changes of gene and pathway that oc- curred in vivo. Further profiling of gene expression changes and ana- lyzing the cholesterol and triglyceride levels in vivo following long-term PM exposure will address these questions. In summary, our study is the first to report that PM10 exposure can modulate genes related to cholesterol and lipid metabolism, providing a new insight into the mechanisms underlying PM induced cardiovascular disease.

The results reported here identified gene expression patterns that are associated with temporal phases of HDI-BT-induced lung injury and are likely to mediate these types of repair functions. This analysis will therefore serve as a basis for delineating molecular mechanisms of isocyanate-induced lung injury.

Our results strongly sug- gest that changes in the diet or supplementation of diets with Genistein may be beneficial in decreasing oxidative stress as a consequence of increased expression of antioxidant defense genes.

As the most abundant, nonprotein thiol present in mamma- lian cells, glutathione (GSH) functions as an essential compo- nent of the cellular antioxidant defense system. Due to its very reactive cysteine sulfhydryl moiety, GSH is enzymatically conjugated to toxic electrophiles by cellular GSH transferases. Additionally, GSH participates as a cosubstrate in various GSH-dependent peroxidase reactions, protecting cells or tis- sues against oxidative damage by metabolizing toxic organic and hydrogen peroxides (for review see Meister and Anderson, 1983; Meister, 1989; Orrenius et al., 1983). These GSH-de- endent reactions form products which are usually less toxic, ore water-soluble, and efficiently excreted from the cell. owever, during the exposure to various chemicals such as edox-cycling quinones, peroxides, or alkylating agents, cellu- ar GSH stores may be depleted, leaving the cells\u2019 antioxidant efense system compromised against oxidant-induced injury nd/or cytotoxicity (Onderwater et al., 1998; Carpenter-Deyo t al., 1991; Bellomo et al., 1987). Similarly, depletion of GSH markedly enhances the cytotoxicity of a variety of chemicals and treatments. Despite the well-known requirements of GSH for protecting cells against these models of chemical toxicity, little is known about GSH homeostasis during cholestasis resulting from hydrophobic bile acid accumulation in the liver. Although a decrease of total liver GSH has been experimen- tally observed in bile duct-ligated rats (as a model for cholesta- sis) (Pastor et al., 1997), the mechanisms and biological sig- nificance of these findings are unclear. Considering the antioxidative function of GSH, we hypothesized that hepato- cytes exposed to GCDC would undergo an oxidative stress leading to increased oxidation of intracellular GSH to GSSG, with subsequent efflux of GSSG from the hepatocyte. Further- more, we anticipated that depletion of GSH would sensitize hepatocytes to bile acid-induced toxicity, while enhancement of cellular GSH levels would be protective. The objectives of the present study were (a) to determine the effect of GCDC on the GSH-dependent protective systems of isolated rat hepato- cytes; and (b) to determine if manipulation of intracellular GSH content affected subsequent GCDC-induced apoptosis and/or necrosis of isolated rat hepatocytes. MATERIALS AND METHODS Materials Bovine serum albumin (BSA) (fraction V) was obtained from Cal Biochem (La Jolla, CA). GSH, GSSG, GSH-monoethyl ester, g-glutamyl glutamate, GCDC) as the sodium salt, 1-chloro-2,4-dinitrobenzene (CDNB), lacate de- ydrogenase (LDH) kits, iodoacetate, and 1-fluoro-2,4-dinitrobenzene were btained from Sigma Chemical Co. (St. Louis, MO). Collagenase (Type II) as obtained from Worthington Biochemical Co. (Freehold, NJ). DAPI (4,6- iamindino-2-phenylindole) hydrochloride was purchased from Molecular robes (Portland, OR). 1-bromoheptane was purchased from Aldrich Chemical o. (Milwaukee, WI). MOWIOL was obtained from Calbiochem (San Diego, A). All other chemicals were of reagent grade or better. Adult, male Sprague\u2013Dawley rats (225\u2013275 g) were obtained from Sasco nc. (Omaha, NE) and housed for 2\u20133 weeks in polyethylene cages with food Purina Lab Chow, Ralston Purina Co., Chicago, IL) and water provided ad ibitum. All animals received humane care in compliance with the guidelines f the Committee on Laboratory Animal Research of the University of Colo- ado Health Sciences Center. Freshly isolated rat hepatocytes were prepared sing a recirculating collagenase perfusion technique that was a modification Sokol et al., 1995) of the method of Berry and Friend (1969). Hepatocytes ere washed three times and ultimately resuspended in Krebs\u2013Ringers\u2013 EPES (KRH) buffer (115 mM NaCl, 5 mM KCl, 1 mM KH2PO4, 1.2 mM MgSO4, and 25 mM Na HEPES), pH 7.4 supplemented with 0.2% bovine serum albumin (BSA), hereafter referred to as KRH buffer. Initial cell viability as measured by trypan blue exclusion was above 90% for all experiments. Aliquots of freshly isolated hepatocyte suspensions were placed in Erlen- meyer flasks at a concentration of approximately 106 cells/ml in a 37\u00b0C shaking water bath in room air and were treated with various concentrations of GCDC for 4 h. In experiments designed to examine the effects of GSH modulation on GCDC-induced cellular injury, compounds were dissolved in either (KRH) or dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) and preincubated with hepato- cytes for 15\u201330 min prior to GCDC addition. The concentration of DMSO never exceeded 0.1% (v/v) and had no affect on any measured parameter. Similarly, preincubation of hepatocytes with either 1-bromoheptane or GSH-EE alone did not affect LDH release or induction of apoptosis. Aliquots were removed hourly and where indicated intra- and extracellular fractions separated by centrifugation at 80g 3 2 min at 4\u00b0C."}},

Results suggest that five polymorphisms in GSTP1, GSTT1, GSS and SEPP1 may influence urine and hair mercury levels, though fur- ther investigation is warranted. Future research on genetic factors influencing mercury toxicokinetics should assess both major mercury exposure sources (amalgam, fish consumption) in larger cohorts using all three biomarkers (urine, blood, hair) and more polymor- phisms in glutathione related enzymes, selenoproteins, and proteins involved in mercury transport to help ascertain sources of biomarker variability and to narrow the gap between the perceived and true health risks accompanying mercury exposure.

In addition, the activation of Nrf2/ARE pathway by nectandrin B is mediat- ed by ERK phosphorylation and AMPK-dependent inhibition of GSK-3\u03b2. Considering its antioxidative and hepatocyte-protective effects along with its ability to attenuate hepatic de novo fatty acid synthesis reported in our previous study, nectandrin B might serve as a promising candi- date to treat NAFLD and prevent its progression.

Chapalamadugu et al. / Toxicology and Applied Pharmacology 282 (2015) 100\u2013107 nucleotides [(NAD(P)H, NAD(H)], in vivo (Kilfoil et al., 2013), and af- fect Kv channel gating and kinetics (Tipparaju et al., 2005). Reduced pyridine nucleotides support Kv inactivation via Kv\u03b21 and 3, whereas oxidized pyridine nucleotides abolish inactivation caused by Kv\u03b2 sub- units (Kilfoil et al., 2013). Based on the overall changes noted in the present study, the increased availability of reduced pyridine nucleo- tides and Kv\u03b2 subunit levels in hyperoxia state would likely cause an increase in the binding of NAD(P)H to Kv\u03b2 subunits and may alter Kv channel gating. In addition the reduced expression of NAD+ depen- dent transcriptional co-suppressor SiRT1 in hyperoxia treated mice hearts was also observed in the present study. SiRT1 regulates a wide range of cellular processes including cell survival, apoptosis, cell growth and metabolism, and deacetylation of histones and non- histone proteins (Finkel et al., 2009). Studies also showed that the mice defective of SiRT1 exhibit severe developmental defects in the heart and did not survive into post-natal stage (Cheng et al., 2003; McBurney et al., 2003). Further, the optimal SiRT1 expression is deemed anti-hypertrophic and cardio-protective, and studies show that cardiac specific deletion of SiRT1 aggravates I/R injury in mice hearts (Abdellatif, 2012; Hsu et al., 2010). Concomitant reduction of Kv1.5 and SiRT1 expression in both hyperoxia exposed hearts and SiRT1 inhibited H9C2 cells explain at least in part the hyperoxia in- duced Kv1.5 downregulation (Fig. 7 and Fig. S2). Decrease in SiRT1 in hyperoxia hearts may be due to the elevation of NADH/NAD+ ratio, which activates CtBP-HIC1 mediated repression of SiRT1 (Zhang et al., 2007). Given that prolonged hyperoxia treatment enhances redox stress in various tissues including the heart (Amicarelli et al., 1999; Bin-Jaliah et al., 2009; Brueckl et al., 2006; Pendyala et al., 2009), and that reduced pyridine nucleotides promote reactive oxygen species in an injured myocardium (Gupte et al., 2006; Ussher et al., 2012), our data point to a potential mechanistic basis for the cardiotoxic effects of hyperoxia treatment observed in this study. Previous research showed that hyperoxia treatment results in reduced body weight in rodents (Factor et al., 2000; He and Zhao, 2008; Hokuto et al., 2004). We have confirmed these findings in both our previous study (Panguluri et al., 2013b) and the current study. Although we did not measure the food intake, decreased cel- lular energy supply is a likely contributor of body weight loss, as concomitant enteral nutrition attenuates hyperoxia induced weight loss in rats (Factor et al., 2000). Also, several studies showed that hyperoxia exposure results in significant lung injury, as featured by elevated oxidative stress, inflammation, alveolar damage and pulmonary edema (Factor et al., 2000; Fukumoto et al., 2013; Kolliputi et al., 2010; Nagato et al., 2012). A recent study showed that hyperoxia exposure adversely affect cellular pathways of aero- bic and anaerobic metabolism in lung tissue decreasing energy availability (Das, 2013). In line with these observations, an earlier study showed that enteral nutritional support of rats under hyperoxia treatment alleviates lung edema through preserved ex- pression of important proteins (Factor et al., 2000). Collectively, it is plausible that the altered energy metabolism and the ensuing perturbations in cellular repertoire required for maintaining opti- mal organ structure and function may at least in part underscore the body weight loss and other deleterious effects of hyperoxia. In conclusion, we show that the hyperoxia treatment of mice leads to: 1) cardiac arrhythmia and decreased repolarization reserve, 2) ele- vated myocardial damage, 3) altered ratios of pyridine nucleotides and 4) decreased SiRT1 and Kv1.5 channel expression along with al- tered redox regulatory gene expression. Our study offers novel insights into the cardiotoxicity and ensued electrophysiological consequences caused by exposure to high levels of oxygen.

A variety of information fromother studies and data on biologic plausibility support our early-life findings. Major reporting bias or confounding seem unlikely but cannot be ruled out. Our findings re- gardingmoderate exposure levels are particularly novel in that they are thefirst with lifetime exposure information to show these types of asso- ciations. Given this novelty, and given the fact that tens of millions of people worldwide are exposed to levels close to this, it would be espe- cially important to confirm these findings in a population with similar exposure levels, good information on relevant confounders, and accu- rate data on arsenic exposure during all life stages.

In particular, the ribotoxin DON-mediated cytosolic translocation of HuR protein and its complex formation with IL-8 transcripts were critical steps in the mRNA stabilization of the gene. Moreover, regulation of transcription factors by HuR protein can also contribute to the expression of IL-8 in human intestinal epithelial cells. Future studies will be aimed at broadening the functionality of HuR protein in response to the diverse mucosal insults including ribotoxic stress in the context of the normal microflora in the gut epithelium.

The present research suggests the importance of coarse inhalable materials, including gram-neg- ative bacterial products and possibly other biocontaminants, associated with cytokine production and decreased antimicro- bial defenses in the lung. Assessment of macrophage responses in vivo, following PM10 inhalation by asthmatic human vol- unteers or instillation into appropriate animal models, should further our understanding of the role of these PM-associated materials in asthma exacerbation and altered host defenses.

The similar phenomenon is reported in rat PC12h cells with nicotine (Nakayama et al., 2001). However, imidaclo- prid is recovered in food (Fernandez-Alba et al., 2000) and its human intestinal absorption is not well known, although the pharmacokinetics of absorption is a major element in xenobiotic action. Thus, the high rate of IMI absorption, the production of potentially toxic metabolites by human P450 enzymes (Schulz-Jander and Casida, 2002; Schulz-Jander et al., 2002), and the presence of parent or metabolite com- pounds in food (Fernandez-Alba et al., 2000) lead us to think that IMI could present a possible toxicity to vertebrate cells and a risk for human health. The characterization of the IMI metabolic pathway and the determination of the toxicity of metabolites are the next steps to investigate the risk to human health associated with the use of imidacloprid in agriculture.

However, abuse of high efficacy, long-acting K2 synthetic cannabinoids for extended periods of time might result in compensatory CB2R down-regulation and desensitization (Howlett, 2005), potentially resulting in an unanticipated increase in drug use. In any case, because these drugs are rarely abused alone (Seely et al., 2011), the potential for chronic exposure to K2 synthetic cannabinoids to alter the development, expression and/or maintenance of depen- dence resulting from concurrent use of marijuana, other synthetic cannabinoids and additional drugs of abuse should be considered.

MAPKs are a group of evolutionarily conserved proline- directed protein serine/threonine kinases that are activated in re- sponse to a variety of extracellular stimuli and mediate signal trans- duction from the cell surface to the nucleus. There are three distinct groups of MAPKs: ERK1/2, p38 MAPK, and JNK (Wang, 2011). SFN has been shown to induce cell apoptosis by stimulating all these three MAPKs in various types of cancer cells (Cho et al., 2005; Juge et al., 2007). In the current study, we further provided evidence that SFN induces phosphorylation of ERK1/2, p38 MAPK, and JNK in PC-3 cells. H2S may mediate the stimulatory role of SFN on these three MAPKs. Firstly, H2S also induced the phosphorylation of all Fig. 7. Both p38 MAPK and JNK were involved in SFN and H2S-inhibited PC-3 cell viability. Bl PC-3 cells were pretreated withMAPK inhibitor(s) for 30 min before treatment with SFN (10 reversed SFN-stimulated phosphorylation of p38 MAPK and JNK. PC-3 cells were treated with representative of three individual experiments. three MAPKs. Secondly, compared with SFN, H2S stimulated all these three MAPKs at the earlier stage of incubation. The phosphorylation of ERK1/2, p38 MAPK, and JNK occurred at 15 min of H2S treatment. For SFN, the phosphorylation of these three MAPKs happened after 30 min of incubation. Thirdly, the intensity and duration of phosphor- ylation of p38 MAPK and JNK in H2S-treated cells were much more compared with those in SFN-incubated cells. In addition, we found that the synchronous phosphorylation of p38 MAPK and JNK were es- sential for SFN and H2S-inhibited cell viability, because blockage of both p38 MAPK and JNK but not alone reversed the inhibitory effects of SFN and H2S on cell viability. More directly, we observed that scav- enging of H2S bymethemoglobin reduced SFN-stimulated phosphory- lation of both p38 MAPK and JNK. Despite these findings, the supplement ofMAPK inhibitors or H2S scavengers did not completely re- verse SFN-decreased cell viability, suggesting that SFN may inhibit cell growth by some other pathways. It is well known that micromole doses of SFN prevent cancer and stimulate cancer cell apoptosis through induction of phase 2 enzymes and enhancing the tran- scription of tumor suppressor proteins (Cho et al., 2005; Juge et al., 2007). SFN also induces many signaling mediators, such as NF- kappaB, the activator protein 1, phosphoinositide 3-kinase, and pro- tein kinase C, etc. (Li et al., 2011). There have been many reports on the effects of H2S on the growth patterns of different types of cells by regulating MAPKs (Wang, 2011; Yang, 2011). We first showed that H2S treatment or CSE overexpression increased the activities of ERK and p38 MAPK, but not JNK, in human aorta smooth muscle cells, suppression of ERK activity, but not of p38 MAPK, inhibited H2S induced apoptosis of human aorta smooth muscle cells (Yang et al., 2004b). In HEK-293 cells, activation of ERK and p38 MAPK was induced by H2S, while only ERK was involved in the cell growth change mediated by H2S (Yang et al., 2004a). We also found that in INS-1E cells, CSE overexpression or H2S application in- creased p38 MAPK activity, and inactivation of p38 MAPK inhibited H2S-induced apoptosis in INS-1E cells (Yang et al., 2007). In contrast, increased endothelial cell proliferation by H2S is associated with sus- tained phosphorylation of ERK1/2 (Papapetropoulos et al., 2009). All these suggest that cell-type specific activations of MAPKs by H2S are required for a variety of cell fate determinations. In conclusion, our results demonstrated that H2S mediates the inhibitory effect of SFN on the proliferation of PC-3 cells by activating both p38 MAPK and JNK. H2S-releasing diet or drugmight be beneficial in the treatment of prostate cancer. This study will also advance our understanding of the physiological role of H2S in prostate cancer, and such an understanding will help reveal pathogenesis of prostate cancer related to abnormal endogenous H2S metabolism and design new gene therapy for the treatment of prostate cancer.

MAPKs are a group of evolutionarily conserved proline- directed protein serine/threonine kinases that are activated in re- sponse to a variety of extracellular stimuli and mediate signal trans- duction from the cell surface to the nucleus. There are three distinct groups of MAPKs: ERK1/2, p38 MAPK, and JNK (Wang, 2011). SFN has been shown to induce cell apoptosis by stimulating all these three MAPKs in various types of cancer cells (Cho et al., 2005; Juge et al., 2007). In the current study, we further provided evidence that SFN induces phosphorylation of ERK1/2, p38 MAPK, and JNK in PC-3 cells. H2S may mediate the stimulatory role of SFN on these three MAPKs. Firstly, H2S also induced the phosphorylation of all Fig. 7. Both p38 MAPK and JNK were involved in SFN and H2S-inhibited PC-3 cell viability. Bl PC-3 cells were pretreated withMAPK inhibitor(s) for 30 min before treatment with SFN (10 reversed SFN-stimulated phosphorylation of p38 MAPK and JNK. PC-3 cells were treated with representative of three individual experiments. three MAPKs. Secondly, compared with SFN, H2S stimulated all these three MAPKs at the earlier stage of incubation. The phosphorylation of ERK1/2, p38 MAPK, and JNK occurred at 15 min of H2S treatment. For SFN, the phosphorylation of these three MAPKs happened after 30 min of incubation. Thirdly, the intensity and duration of phosphor- ylation of p38 MAPK and JNK in H2S-treated cells were much more compared with those in SFN-incubated cells. In addition, we found that the synchronous phosphorylation of p38 MAPK and JNK were es- sential for SFN and H2S-inhibited cell viability, because blockage of both p38 MAPK and JNK but not alone reversed the inhibitory effects of SFN and H2S on cell viability. More directly, we observed that scav- enging of H2S bymethemoglobin reduced SFN-stimulated phosphory- lation of both p38 MAPK and JNK. Despite these findings, the supplement ofMAPK inhibitors or H2S scavengers did not completely re- verse SFN-decreased cell viability, suggesting that SFN may inhibit cell growth by some other pathways. It is well known that micromole doses of SFN prevent cancer and stimulate cancer cell apoptosis through induction of phase 2 enzymes and enhancing the tran- scription of tumor suppressor proteins (Cho et al., 2005; Juge et al., 2007). SFN also induces many signaling mediators, such as NF- kappaB, the activator protein 1, phosphoinositide 3-kinase, and pro- tein kinase C, etc. (Li et al., 2011). There have been many reports on the effects of H2S on the growth patterns of different types of cells by regulating MAPKs (Wang, 2011; Yang, 2011). We first showed that H2S treatment or CSE overexpression increased the activities of ERK and p38 MAPK, but not JNK, in human aorta smooth muscle cells, suppression of ERK activity, but not of p38 MAPK, inhibited H2S induced apoptosis of human aorta smooth muscle cells (Yang et al., 2004b).

Our PCR and western blot results showed that the expression of SF-1, CYP11, 3\u03b2-HSD and 17\u03b2-HSD were up- regulated in the ICA+DMEM/F12 group compared with controls. Andric et al. showed that sildenafil, another PDE5 inhibitor, promoted Leydig cell steroid production through the cAMP-PKA and NO-cGMP signaling pathways (Andric et al., 2010). ICA may also be used to treat male erectile dysfunction by inhibiting PDE5 activity and enhancing NO-cGMP pathway activity (Wang et al., 2017. Whether ICA can promote CREB phosphorylation via the NO-cGMP pathway, and thereby downregulate its target genes, such as StAR and CYP11, to regulate the synthesis of testosterone remains unclear. ICA promoted estrogen synthesis in ovarian granulosa cells (Yang et al., 2013), but whether it can promote the expression of SF-1 in Leydig cells through the cAMP-PKA signaling pathway needs further study.

Our PCR and western blot results showed that the expression of SF-1, CYP11, 3\u03b2-HSD and 17\u03b2-HSD were up- regulated in the ICA+DMEM/F12 group compared with controls. Andric et al. showed that sildenafil, another PDE5 inhibitor, promoted Leydig cell steroid production through the cAMP-PKA and NO-cGMP signaling pathways (Andric et al., 2010). ICA may also be used to treat male erectile dysfunction by inhibiting PDE5 activity and enhancing NO-cGMP pathway activity (Wang et al., 2017. Whether ICA can promote CREB phosphorylation via the NO-cGMP pathway, and thereby downregulate its target genes, such as StAR and CYP11, to regulate the synthesis of testosterone remains unclear. ICA promoted estrogen synthesis in ovarian granulosa cells (Yang et al., 2013), but whether it can promote the expression of SF-1 in Leydig cells through the cAMP-PKA signaling pathway needs further study.

Secondly, we verified that only two of these markers, CD124 and Isabelle Langonn\u00e9-2, have the potential to classify chemical allergens with moderate or low immunogenic potential. Neither IgE nor Isabelle Langonn\u00e9-4 production was distinctive, although they may provide additional in- formation. While this approach has been tested on a limited number of sensitizers, it may lead to improved characterization of chemical al- lergens by allowing a variety of sensitizers to be screened.

The high expression of catabolizing enzymes, the higher levels of apoptosis and cell stress, induced by Pb along with Pb's ability to alter immunity are proposed to increase any genetic penetrance for an autoimmune disease. Additionally, the well described effects of Pb on multiple organ systems, including the central nervous, cardiovascular, and reproductive systems could be related to systemic inflammation resulting from the described catabolic activities induced by Pb.

Moreover, microarray based-gene expres- sion was more altered by DTPE than by DNTPE and non-supervised cluster analysis allowed for the discrimination of DTPE from DNTPE. Consistent disruptions of steroidogenesis related-gene expression such as Star, Cyp19a1, Hsd17b8, and Nr4a3 were observed in DTPE group, but not in the DNTPE group. Our observation on cell viability, cytotoxicity, and microarray-based gene expression analysis induced by PEs demonstrate that our in vitro 3D-SGC system mimicked in vivo responses for phthalates and suggests that the 3D-SGC system might be useful in identifying the effects of developmental reproductive toxicants.

Moreover, this means that we cannot elucidate and categorize the structures of phospholipidosis inducing and non-inducing compounds solely on the basis of the presence or absence of thewidely recognized CAD structural motif. This evidence leads us to further investigate more specific phys- icochemical parameters which may be adopted from the molecular de- scriptors used and found in common from the two different platforms (Table 6) during construction of the DIPL models. Even though both platforms use different algorithms and descriptor packages, they share common chemical properties including atomic charge descriptors, to- pological distance descriptors, etc.We anticipate that this physicochem- ical information will help refine the CAD category and potentially provide needed insight into the mechanisms responsible for DIPL. Next steps will include investigation into use of the models to explore mechanismof action, development of consensus prediction approaches, and continuous validation of models with more external data as they become known through submissions to the FDA.

Cavaliere et al. / Toxicology and Applied Pharmacology 330 (2017) 93\u201399 approaches could aid to differentiate between pathogenic and neutral nsSNPs and to target mutations associated to a disease. The presence of a variation in the coding region could induce a conformational change in the overall structure or in the drug binding groove, affecting binding affinity. The use of molecular dynamics simulation has provided us to analyze the impact of a single nucleotide variation on drug sensibility. This approach has allowed us to overcome cost and time problems of in vitro screening in evaluating the impact of the single point mutation at amino acid positions 256 (a Lys to Arg transversion) in the sequence of integrin\u03b14 subunit on natalizumab insensitivity. Natalizumab is a hu- manizedmonoclonal antibody IgG4 and is approved formultiple sclero- sis treatment. By using of molecular dynamics simulation and the HINT score, we have not identified K256R as a causative for drug sensitivity. On the other hand, the HINT score, RMSF, RMSD and H-bonds results provide a clear insight of slightly higher stability of the mutated com- plex with respect to the native form. The results show that computa- tional simulations provide a useful approach in pharmacogenetics for examining the effect of an SNP in binding affinity. We should mention that at the timewhenwe started this study, the K256R variationwas an- notated as a polymorphism, but its frequency was unknown. Recently, the MAF index has been updated and it would seem that the variation is in realty a mutation. These data could confirm our results, since this variation is present at too low frequency to justify the number of pa- tients not sensitive to natalizumab. In conclusion, from the simulation and genetic data we can confirm that K256R variation is not the cause of the absence of reactivity to this drug.

The four silica nano- particles demonstrated differences in cytotoxic and embryotoxic effects despite their identical chemical composition. Taken together, our results indicate that the widespread application of amorphous silica nanoparticles may not be without any health hazards. Long term exposure of humans to high concentrations of these nanoparticles could potentially result in particle accumulation and subsequently, induce acute or chronic toxicity. A relatively high systemic exposure to silica nanoparticles might also be harmful to the embryo. Therefore, more research is warranted investigating the underlying mechanisms of these effects and the potential of these nanoparticles to migrate into the uterus, placenta and embryo.

Therefore, the results of the in vitro data with BDE-100 in this study and the confirmation of in vivo effects as seen in three different rat models affirm that the effects of the penta mixtures may pose real concerns for adverse effects on human reproductive function and sexual development.

We think these results shed light into the mechanisms of (PhTe)2-induced neurodegeneration in rat striatum, evidencing a critical role for the PKA, MAPK and Akt signaling pathways causing disruption of cytoskeletal homeostasis, which could be related with apoptotic neuronal death and astrogliosis. Fig. 9. Schematic representation of themechanismsof (PhTe)2-inducedneurodegeneration in rat striatum. The neurotoxicant injected in 15 day-old rats activated signaling pathways 6 days after injection. The molecular mechanisms involved PKA, MAPK and caspase 3 acti- vation and Akt inhibition, causing disruption of cytoskeletal homeostasis, which in turn, could be related with the apoptotic process of neuronal cells and astrogliosis.

What remains to be elucidated is the mechanism by which silica- loaded APC activate T cells. Silica particles may simply increase overall macrophage functions indiscriminately, or alter specific components directly involved in T cell activation. In addition, the predominance of Th2 immunity in the fibrotic stages of silicosis suggests a shift from Th1 immunity to Th2, further complicating the situation. Future experiments may shed light on the relationship between the increase in APC activity in our silicosis model and Th1- versus Th2-mediated immunity in the later fibrotic stages.

Concretely, prenatal caffeine ingestion can induce the DNA hypermethylation of SR-BI promoter and inhibit SR-BI expression in fetal adrenals, which could subsequently suppress the cholesterol uptake followed by the decreased production of steroid hormones and increased IUGR rates. We have reported that prenatal caffeine ingestion increased maternal serum corticosterone levels and induced IUGR in rats, which suggested that IUGR induced by prenatal caffeine ingestionmay related to over-exposure tomaternal glucocorticoids (Kou et al., 2014; Xu et al., 2012b). The HPA axis of these IUGR offspring exhibits a low basal activity and an enhanced sensitivity to chronic stress. Combined with our previous reports and the current study, we propose that maternal prenatal caffeine ingestion retards the development of the fetal HPA axis function by the direct toxic effects on fetal adrenal steroidogenesis and by fetal over-exposure to maternal glucocorticoids. These effects could conjointly lead to retarded fetal de- velopment and high susceptibility to adult metabolic syndrome. Our present study provided an epigenetic mechanism for elucidating the toxicity of caffeine on fetal adrenal development from the perspective of cholesterol uptake. And it also provides evidence for exploring the fetal origin of adult HPA axis dysfunction and metabolic syndrome sus- ceptibility for caffeine-induced IUGR offspring. Further analysis will be needed to confirm the long-term effect of caffeine on adrenal cholester- ol uptake and steroidogenesis in IUGR offspring.

The ability of tanshinones to induce these carcinogen metabolizing enzymes may be an important consideration in the assessment of drug\u2013drug interaction and toxicity susceptibility associated with human exposure to the tanshinone analogs. However, additional information is needed before the significance of the tanshinone-induced CYP1A1/2 can be fully understood.

Our data clearly demonstrate that oleandrin could be a potent anti-tumor promoting agent because it inhibits several biomarkers of TPA-induced tumor promo- tion in an in vivo animal model.

While these studies need to be performed in vivo, our results suggest that activation of NMDA receptors plays a major role in protecting neurons against paraoxon-mediated neurotoxicity and apoptosis. In addition, inhibition of a-7 nicotinic receptors in cultured hippocampal and cerebellar granule cells is neuroprotective albeit at a lower level. Our results suggest that neuronal cell apoptosis may be one of the contributing factors of the adverse neuronal effects of paraoxon in the CNS.

Cytochrome P450 reductase is important not only in drugmetabolism, but also in mediating a number of key enzymatic reactions including those involved in sterol biosynthesis and metabolism, fatty acid metabolism, bile acid synthesis and heme catabolism (Henderson et al., 2003). Thus, inhibition of cytochrome P450 reductase activity is likely to have significant adverse consequences in tissues targeted by vesicants includingmaintaining homeostasis and responding to injury and oxidative stress. Of particular interest was our novel finding that CEES stimulates NADPH-dependent production of ROS, a process that may contribute to pulmonary oxidative stress. Further studies are required to elucidate the molecular mechanism by which CEES inhibits substrate reduction by cytochrome P450 reductase while at the same time, stimulating the production of ROS.

In summary, GSE, a powerful antioxidant with diverse beneficial effects such as its against reactive oxygen species and oxidative stress as well as being anti- inflammatory, might be a promising agent in protecting hepatic tissue against oxidative damage and in preventing hepatic fibrosis and dysfunction due to choronic arsenic exposure at low concentration in drinking water.

Treatment with corticosteroids has been investigated previously in animal models of chlorine-induced lung injury. Budesonide and betamethasone administered in a pig model of chlorine-induced acute lung injury im- proved arterial oxygenation and lung compliance (Wang et al., 2005), while budesonide treatment alone in this same model inhibited chlorine-induced increases in lung wet:dry weight ratio (Wang et al., 2002). Administration of dexamethasone in rat models of chlorine in- jury was effective in inhibiting acute inflammation (Demnati et al., 1998; Wigenstam et al., 2016). We have previously shown that some acute effects of chlorine inhalation, including neutrophil influx and pulmonary edema, were inhibited by treatment with mometasone and budesonide in FVB/NJ mice (Chen et al., 2013; Hoyle et al., 2016). Treatment of chlorine-exposed BALB/C mice with dexamethasone was shown to produce partial inhibition of acute neutrophilic inflammation and airway hyperreactivity but nearly complete inhibition of airway hyperreactivity measured 14 days after exposure (Jonasson et al., 2013). In addition, other types of anti-inflammatory treatments in- hibited acute inflammation and airway hyperreactivity caused by chlorine inhalation (McGovern et al., 2015; Hamamoto et al., 2017). In the current study, budesonide treatment inhibited multiple aspects of chlorine-induced injury evident 7 days after exposure, including Fig. 9. Distribution of airway epithelial cells after cessation of budesonide treatment. Mice were ex- posed to chlorine and treated with either vehicle or budesonide intramuscularly for 7 days starting 1 h after exposure. Lungs were collected 7, 10, or 14 after exposure (1, 4, or 8 days after cessation of bu- desonide treatment). Immunofluorescence staining was performed on lung sections for keratin 5 (basal cell marker), club cell secretory protein (CCSP; club cell marker), and acetylated tubulin (ciliated cell marker). Arrows in panels E and G indicate clusters of K5-stained epithelial cells. Arrow in panel H in- dicates a cluster of CCSP-stained cells.

Discussion Conflict of interest Funding source References", "Compliance with ethical standards": "The effects of corticosteroids have been examined previously in chlorine lung injury models. Chlorine lung injury was examined in anesthetized, mechanically ventilated pigs (Gunnarsson et al., 2000; Wang et al., 2002, 2004, 2005). In this model, chlorine was introduced into the airways of unconscious animals through an endotracheal tube, in contrast to the whole-body procedure used herein, which more closely replicates the usual route of exposure for chlorine poisoning. Corticoste- roids (beclomethasone, budesonide, or betamethasone) administered to chlorine-exposed pigs improved arterial oxygenation, increased lung compliance, reduced pulmonary hypertension, and inhibited pulmonary edema. Beneficial effects of corticosteroids were dependent on adminis- tering the compounds within 30 min of exposure (Wang et al., 2002). Inhaled and systemic corticosteroids appeared to be equally effective in inhibiting lung injury (Wang et al., 2005). The effects of i.p. dexa- methasone on lung injury in chlorine-exposed rats have been exam- ined (Demnati et al., 1998). Dexamethasone administered immediately after exposure and then daily thereafter inhibited the chlorine-induced increase in airway resistance 3 days after exposure and airway hyperreactivity 2 days after exposure but did not significantly affect these parameters 1 day after exposure. Dexamethasone also inhibited neutrophils in lung lavage fluid 1 day after exposure. Similar to the pig studies, our results showed reduced pulmonary edema with corticoste- roid treatment. In contrast to these former studies, we did not observe an effect of mometasone or budesonide treatment on pulmonary edema evaluated 6 h after exposure (not shown),which could reflect differences in species, chlorine exposure method, conscious vs. anesthetized ani- mals, or inhaled vs. systemic administration of corticosteroids. We also observed significant effects of corticosteroids administered 1 h after chlorine exposure, which could be an important extension of the window of efficacy if large numbers of patients require simultaneous treatment. We observed inhibition of the initial neutrophil influx into the lungs at 6 h and of the number of neutrophils in lavage fluid at 48 h, which was an overall similar effect to the previous rat study considering the different kinetics of chlorine-induced neutrophil influx between the different models (Demnati et al., 1998; Tian et al., 2008). Corticosteroid treatment failed to inhibit airway hyperreactivity to inhaled methacholine in chlorine-exposed mice, which was similar to what was observed in rats (Demnati et al., 1998). We previously reported that rolipram, a type 4 phosphodiesterase inhibitor, inhibited chlorine-induced airway hyperreactivity (Hoyle, 2010). Corticosteroids may be a useful adjunct to phosphodiesterase inhibitor or \u00df-agonist therapy (Song et al., 2011), as corticosteroids can potentially synergize in multiple ways with agents that raise cyclic AMP levels (Barnes, 2002; Dagenais et al., 2001; Skinner et al., 1989; Wang et al., 2004). The Homeland Security Council has estimated that an attack on an industrial site or train tanker cars leading to the intentional release of chlorine in an urban area could lead to as many as 17,500 deaths and 100,000 hospitalizations from chlorine exposure (Homeland Security Council, 2004). A disaster of this magnitude would overwhelm local health care capacity and drives the need for medical countermeasures that could be rapidly administered in thefield bypersonnelwith limited medical training. Both inhaled and systemically delivered corticoste- roids have been used clinically to treat chlorine-induced lung injury (Van Sickle et al., 2009). Inhaled countermeasures have disadvantages, as these could be difficult to administer to victims who were uncon- scious or those with lung injury that limited the penetration of inhaled drugs. Systemic corticosteroids are typically given intravenously, but this method is impractical for initial field use with large numbers of ca- sualties because of the time and expertise required. Our results show proof-of-principle for systemic administration of corticosteroids in treating chlorine-induced lung inflammation and pulmonary edema. Future studieswill investigate the feasibility of developing formulations that could be used for intramuscular administration of corticosteroids, either alone or in combination with other potential countermeasures, thereby providing a rapid and simple delivery method."}},

Moreover, these inhibitory effects of KYKZL-1 were found to be associated with suppression of phosphorylation of MAPKs and NF-kB inactiva- tion via the blockade of I\u03baB-\u03b1 phosphorylation and inactivation of IKKs. Since NF-kB is a transcription factor that regulates the transcriptions of many genes associated with inflammation, the above results also suggest that KYKZL-1 contain remarkable anti- inflammatory activity with an improved gastric profile and may present a potential promising safer chemical alternative for tradi- tional NSAIDs and selective COX-2 inhibitors for the treatment of in- flammatory diseases.

These studies suggest that the short-lived immunomodulatory activity observed with AEA might be closely associated with its lability in biological systems. In addition, F-Me-AEA represents yet another cannabinoid compound that exerts potent effects on NF-AT DNA binding activity, further supporting the notion that NF-AT is a critical target of suppression by cannabinoids. The cannabinoid-induced suppression of NF-AT activity likely contributes to the pleiotropic effects of these compounds in lymphocytes.

DADS also inhibits the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines (TNF-\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2 and MCP-1) by suppressing their expression levels. These effects are mediated by attenuation of NF-\u03baB translocation from the cytoplasm to the nucleus, which is accompanied by blocking of AP-1, PI3K/Akt and MAPK pathways. This suggests that DADS is of importance in the development of neuroprotective agents to treat inflammatory and neurodegenerative diseases.

The gel was stained in ethidium bromide, and photographed under UV illumination. Different drugs induced either an intact DNA band (indicative of DNA damage) or DNA lane (indicative of apoptosis) in different cancer cells. The intensity of these bands or the length of these lanes was modified by incubation with celecoxib in different sequences. 285R.A.

Moreover, less toxicity was noted in rats exposed to both OP insecticides concurrently than in rats treated sequentially with CPF first. Differential interaction with sites of bioactivation and other macromolecular tar- gets are likely to be critical factors contributing to se- quence-dependent toxicity of these OP insecticides. Al- though in vitro studies with OP mixtures may give information on the nature of interaction, further in vivo studies may be critical for evaluating a differential role of toxicokinetic and toxicodynamic modulating factors in such interactive toxicity.

Acknowledgment Discussion Conflict of interest disclosure statement\ufffd Acknowledgment References", "Disclosure": "79B.L. Williams et al. / Toxicology and Applied Pharmacology 233 (2008) 76\u201380 Given the inability of the researchers to agree on protocol, the IRB was asked to review the matter. The IRB required the principle investigator to complete a standard adverse event report. This posed the third major complication for the study; we were being asked to report and designate these findings as an \u201cadverse\u201d occurrence irrespective of the lack of evidence supporting such a designation. An adverse event is commonly defined as any harm experienced by a subject that resulted during the course of his participation. Usually applied to clinical trials, adverse event reporting is meant to provide the IRB with the ability to monitor unexpected events in order to maintain reasonable level of protection to subjects. Although the initial results were unexpected, there was clearly inadequate evidence to conclude that the subjects were at an acute risk. Nonetheless, we submitted the report to the IRB. After review, the IRB supported the retesting of the initial and duplicate samples prior to disclosure and directed the researchers to devise a disclosure plan in the event the initial results were confirmed. The samples were sent to the CDC for reanalysis which confirmed our suspicions. Only three of the samples had detectable amounts of mercury in the blood. After receiving these results, we worked with our initial chemists to identify the source of error in the original analysis. Consequently, we concluded that the initial samples had become contaminated with an external mercury source. Given mercury\u2019s propensity to stick to all surfaces, special precautions were taken to insure that contamination from sample to sample or from standard to sample did not occur during analysis. However, these precautions failed because the system used to de-ionize the water for dilution of the samples had begun releasing solid particulate and measurable breakthrough occurred. After diluting the samples, small differences were detected between the contaminated samples and non-contaminated samples. This contamination was additionally problematic to detect because it did not affect all samples equally and the quality control samples were all within specification.

Evidence that the intestinal epithelium is capable of transporting luminal GSH to augment intracellular peroxide catabolism and the notion that the etiology of chronic gut pathologies may be directly linked to an early loss of mucosal redox balance suggest that dietary strategies for intestinal redox maintenance would be a viable consideration in chronic gut disease management.

Because of their potent spermicidal activity, low irritation potential, and lack of systemic toxicity, vanadocenes have particular clinical potential as a new class of non-deter- gent-type vaginal contraceptive agents.

This work was partially funded through DAMD 17-99-9010. References", "Acknowledgement": "Interpretation of the results described in this report is complicated by multiple and competing factors. Although the effect of ionic environment on the biological availability of HD active species (to either critical extracellular membrane or intracellular (DNA?) components) must certainly impact HD toxicity, it does not seem likely that it is a major contributing factor to the overall toxicity observed in these studies. Rather, the data support the hypothesis that the early events that lead to HD toxicity are closely regulated by monovalent ionic (most especially anionic) environment at biochem- ical sites. The inhibition of NHE does not appear to be causal to HD- induced toxicity. However, given the profound and persistent cytosolic acidification induced by HD, as well as its time- and concentration-dependent inhibitory effects on pHi regulatory mechanisms, it appears necessary to establish the importance of HD-induced effects on other antiporter systems involved in intracel- lular pH regulation. Studies are currently underway to investigate the importance of these systems in determining the toxicity of HD in the target cells of HD-induced vesication, namely human basal skin keratinocytes.

Earlier studies have shown that CYP2F2 is highly localized to Clara cells of the mouse but little information of specific sites of protein localization is available in other species (Buckpitt et al., 1995). Unfortunately, relatively lower specific activi- ties of naphthalene turnover were observed in isolated mouse Clara cells (Chichester et al., 1994) than in whole dissected airway explants leading to the conclusion that isolated cells likely did not provide a quantitatively robust estimate of naphthalene turnover in target cells. The possibility that metabolites are generated in other metabol- ically active tissues such as the liver which circulate to the lung can- not be ruled out. Finally, dissected airways of primates generate proportionally high amounts of protein bound metabolites (Boland et al., 2004) and several of the adducted proteins isolated from mon- key nasal epithelial incubations are identical to those isolated from rat nasal olfactory epithelial incubations (DeStefano-Shields et al., 2010). The reasons for the apparent mismatch between slow rates of naphthalene metabolism with easily detectable formation of pro- tein adducts are not obvious.

However, DO11.10 mice were on a BALB/c background which tends toward a Th2 response even under normal conditions. Although Pb allo-enhancement has been observed regardless of the haplotype of the responding strain (McCabe et al., 2001), the phenotype of responding T cells was not assessed in this study. It will be important in the future to characterize the phenotype of allo-reactive T cells in the presence and absence of Pb.

It had been hypothesized that Pb ions might induce dicentric chromo- some aberrations (Wise et al., 1994) or that they might be mitogenic allowing cells to escape the cytotoxic effects of chromate (Carlisle et al., 2000; Wise et al., 2002, 2003, 2004a). In previous reports, we found that Pb ions were not genotoxic in human bronchial cells (Wise et al., 2004a). In this report, we find that Pb does not affect the growth of human lung cells and does not cause cells to escape the cytotoxic effect of chromate ions. Thus, the likely hypoth- eses that would explain the greater carcinogenicity of particulate chromate is either that the cation (such as Pb) interferes with DNA repair or perhaps the difference is a consequences of chronic exposure to chromate ions and the cation plays no mechanistic role. Future research is aimed at exploring these two hypotheses.

PC-SOD is well tolerated and shows no signs of toxicity even at very high doses. Very importantly, in our studies, PC-SOD did not show any sign of interference with the antitumor effect of doxorubicin. These data suggest that PC-SOD is a suitable candidate for further investigations on the prevention of doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity.

In this study, the anti-apoptotic effects of LAB were demonstrated by the down-regulation of the apoptotic pathways of c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase (JNK) and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), and the up-regulation of the anti-apoptotic pathway of Nrf2/HO-1 and Sirt1 expression.

While the source of continuous ALT elevations remains elusive, the biomarker data and pathology findings support an initial liver injury followed by adaptation and repair. Based on the relative sensitivity of human hepatocytes to NP260 toxicity, it is reasonable to assume that NP260 would be directly liver toxic in the clinic at the doses tested, while the potential for adap- tation in humans is unknown. Taken together, analysis of novel bio- markers along in vitro hepatocyte studies provided useful information in predicting a potential for NP260 to cause liver toxicity in the clinic.

Yet despite many years of academic and industrial research, there re- mains a distinct need to bridge the translational gap between in vitro DILI models and DILI as it appears in vivo (Usta et al., 2015). In this study, the utility of mono-cultures of fresh rat and cryopre- served human hepatocytes to predict human hepatotoxicity was com- pared with that of a model consisting of cryopreserved primary hepato- cytes from human, rat or dog co-cultured with a stromal cell line. A total of compounds were studied, of which Sample Set I comprised 19 well- characterized molecular entities, 12 hepatotoxicants and 7 non-hepato- toxicants, for which human clinical data exists (Table 1). In addition, Sample Set II comprised 10 compounds for which Sanofi has proprietary data, 9 of which had been discontinued from drug development during pre-clinical animal studies or during Phase I or II clinical trials in which hepatotoxicity was detected. The compounds of Sample Set II were ret- rospectively studied to see if a long-enduring primary hepatic co-culture model might have identified the potential for hepatotoxicity that did not, until relatively late in the process, present liver signals severe enough to contribute to a decision to halt development (Table 5). The data from Sample Set I show a concordance of 50\u201375% True Positives in the mono-culture models, with human mono-culture sen- sitivity being the lowest at 50% and greater sensitivity seen in fresh rat hepatocyte mono-culture at 75% (Table 2). Higher sensitivity was at- tained when these compounds were incubated in the rat or human primary hepatocyte co-culture system for s, with both species' co- cultures scoring a sensitivity value of 83%. Sensitivity in the dog co- culture was the highest of all the models assessed, at %. The co- cultures' TC50/Cmax values measured at 24 h after a single treatment were frequently higher (less sensitive) than those observed in the mono- cultures. A possible explanation for this pattern of response is that the co-cultures are innately more robust than the mono-cultures, and therefore not only capable of maintaining their viability and cellular competency longer, but also less susceptible to initial insult by any given concentration of hepatotoxicant. Fig. 2 shows the progression of toxicity over time for acetaminophen and cyclophosphamide in the co-cultures, with some species-specific differences evident with respect to both compounds. When exposed to cyclophosphamide, the human co-cultures were the least sensitive, rat co-cultures were intermediate, and dog co-cultures were the most sensitive. More subtle but significant patterns of differences in toxicity were seen over time when the three species were exposed to acet- aminophen, with the rat co-cultures showing less sensitivity than either the human or dog co-cultures. Inter-species comparisons such as these are critical to determining the relative importance of the respective species' signals for assessing potential human risk. One study found a true positive human toxicity concordance rate of % for multiple species, with non-rodents being predictive for % of human toxicity and rodents alone for only 43% (Olson et al., 2000). Other reports have indicated species specific differences in transporter mediated uptake (Menochet et al., 2012) and metabolism (Drobna et al., 2010) of certain compounds and have linked these metabolic differences to the resulting hepatotoxicity. Having information of the type described here available early in the discovery process can influence the choice to move a compound into development, as well as provide additional insight into which pre-clinical species would be best suited for that compound's in vivo toxicology studies. Interspecies comparisons could also trigger additional investigations to aid in determining the mechanism of the differential response, further characterizing the liabilities of and aiding in decision making on progression of a chemical series. The data in Table 3 show the ability of the Hurel co-culture systems to distinguish between structurally and functionally similar compounds with differing hepatotoxic potential. Macitentan and bosentan are both en- dothelin receptor antagonists, for the treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension. Bosentan has a black box warning for hepatotoxicity, whereas macitentan is classified as a non-hepatotoxicant (Dingemanse et al., 20). Macitentan was not called as a positive in any species of co- cultures, while bosentan was called as a hepatotoxicant in all species of the co-cultures after s of repeat-dose treatment. Bosentan toxicity was detected only in the co-culture models and was not detected after 24- h treatment in either of the mono-culture models. It has recently been shown that bosentan produced cholestatic liver injury (Xu et al., 2015) in humanized mouse livers due to BSEitan Pludwinski inhibition, which may also account for the results reported here. The longevity of the co-cultures may allow the necessary time for the hepatocytes to produce and accumulate bile acids in a sufficient quantity to produce a toxic outcome. In an effort to explore whether additional, predictively useful in- formation can be derived from the long-term repeat-dose methods de- scribed here, time-based toxicity ratios were calculated by dividing each compound's TC50/Cmax value measured at 24 h after a single dose by the TC50/Cmax value obtained after repeat-dosing for either 7 or 13 days (Table 4). In four instances (benzbromarone, amiodarone, bosentan, and acetaminophen) positive time-based toxicity ratio signals arose from Sample Set I compounds that were also correctly called positive by the TC50/Cmax scores produced in the 13-day human co-culture assay. In the other nine hepatotoxicants of Sample Set I, the time-based toxicity ratio did not predict hepatotoxicity. Positive ratio signals were also observed for macitentan and propranolol, two of the seven compounds listed as non-hepatotoxic in Sample Set I, reducing the specificity of this new metric when compared to the TC50/Cmax measurements applied to this Sample Set Thus, utilized as straightforward numerical predictors of he- patotoxicity, the time-based toxicity ratio generated sensitivity and spe- cificity scorings significantly inferior to those afforded by the metric of TC50/Cmax applied to 13-day repeat-dose assays in the co-cultures. The reasons for this pattern of results are not currently understood. However, all four instances in which positive time-based toxicity ratios were observed for hepatotoxicants in Sample Set I occurred with compounds known to exert their toxic effects through alterations in bile salt transport (bosentan) (Fouassier et al., 2002), reactive metabolite formation (benzbromarone) (Yoshida et al., 2017) and acetaminophen (Ramachandran and Jaeschke, 2017), or alteration of lipid metabolism (amiodarone) (Szalowska et al., 2014), phenomena generally not seen without repeat dosing over extended time periods in animals. In con- trast, in the case of all the Sample Set I reference hepatotoxicants that produced negative ratio signals, the mechanism of action is classified in the literature as unknown, complex multifactorial, or idiosyncratic. Two compounds not associated with clinical or non-clinical hepato- toxicity showed positive time-based ratio signals. Similarly to bosentan, examination of the literature on macitentan indicates the compound is capable of producing alterations in bile salt transport leading to choles- tasis. Data has previously been generated which shows macitentan to be a potent inhibitor of BSEitan Pludwinski, OATP, and other hepatic transporters, and therefore a compound capable of causing cholestatic hepatotoxicity; in- deed, macitentan has been found to be a more potent inhibitor of those transporters than the structurally similar compound bosentan, which has a black box warning for hepatotoxicity (Raja and Dreyfus, 2008) and which produced high time-based toxicity ratio signals of 7.8 and 19.7 in the human co-culture after 7 and 13 days. Why bosentan is a hepato- toxicant and macitentan may simply be due to the higher potency, and therefore lower clinical dose requirement (~10-fold less) of macitentan compared to that of bosentan, which affords a greater safety margin in the case of macitentan (Dingemanse et al., 2014). The time-based ratio signal of 4.4 calculated for propranolol was just above the chosen cutoff value of 4.0The reason for the positive time-based toxicity ratio signal being generated by this non-hepatotoxic compound is not known. Propranolol may be an example of a com- pound where additional studies conducted to enable a weight-of-evi- dence decision on toxic potential would outweigh this finding and lead to the correct conclusion of lack of relative risk. Propranolol's Cmax of .20 \u03bcM is the lowest of any of the 19 compounds of Sample Set I, in- cluding macitentan's low Cmax of .30 \u03bcM, suggesting that like maci- tentan, propranolol's high potency may be a factor contributing to its E.I. Novik et al. Toxicology and Applied Pharmacology 336 (2017) 20\u201330 29 non-hepatotoxicity (Table 2). A further demonstration of the potential utility of the time-based toxicity ratio can be seen in the data from the evaluation of the ten pro- prietary Sanofi test compounds of Sample Set II. As shown in Table 5, three of the nine compounds that were discontinued and had liver toxicity signals produced positive time-based toxicity ratio signals that would have been sufficient to raise concern about the hepatotoxic potential of these mole- cules prior to or in parallel with the performance of pre-clinical animal studies. In a weight-of-evidence approach to decision-making on compound progression, these data may have enabled selection of other candidates without this potential for adverse effects on the liver, or informed the guidance provided to the medicinal chemists charged with minimizing the toxic liabilities associated with lead and pre-candidate compounds. The available information suggests that time-based ratio signals may, if utilized as adjuncts to traditional TC50/Cmax or TC50 measure- ments, enhance the process of lead selection and advancement as a part of a comprehensive approach to early drug development. These ratios may signal the presence of a toxic mechanism that requires repeat- dosing over an extended time course in order to become evident; and they may therefore assist in a comprehensive data-based assessment of potential risk. Development decisions are seldom made on the basis of a single data point, but the availability of data from an assay with reliable predictive value can help to rank order compounds and flag compounds for further evaluation and/or structural modification before a decision to progress the compound is made. In summary, the results of the present study indicate the potential of long-enduring co-cultured primary hepatocytes to enhance the pre- dictive capability of in vitro screens for hepatotoxicity. Conventional screens using plated mono-cultures of freshly isolated primary hepa- tocytes from rats, or cryopreserved primary hepatocytes from humans, demonstrate less sensitivity in their ability to predict eventual outcome in an in vivo preclinical or clinical setting than do the results obtained from H\u03bcrel co-cultures. Time-based toxicity ratios may further facilitate early decision making by indicating the presence of a mechanism of action that requires repeat-dosing to become evident. Availability of this data early in the discovery/development process has the potential to avoid late-stage failures in drug development programs. While the data of the present study are interesting and suggest a potential improvement in the ability to predict human hepatotoxicity, there are clearly opportunities for further enhancement and improve- ment. The current data are based on the quantitation of ATP produc- tion. Although this endpoint is used routinely in cytotoxicity assays, additional endpoints could further enhance the predictive value of this assay system. The use of albumin secretion, for example, is one such potential improvement. In addition, microRNA's are becoming im- portant biomarkers of cellular toxicity that can, in some cases, precede significant morphologic tissue damage and thus provide useful trans- lational biomarkers. The use of miR1, for example, will be the subject of further exploration to determine if this endpoint can improve the overall predictive capability of the system.

Moreover, dynamics of cortical KYNA changes in in vivo studies indicate at least biphasic time-dependent effect of nicotine. The increased KYNA synthesis in in vitro studies does not confirm the hypothesis that KYNA formation is directly regulated through nicotine-induced activation and desensitization of nAChRs present in astrocytes. Subtle changes in KAT I and KAT II activities may partially explain the observed KYNA increase. The effect of nicotine on KYNA synthesis seems to be unique and its understanding can make a step in the research on pharmacological manipulations in kynurenine pathway and their therapeutic benefits in the treatment of CNS disorders.

Those cells exhibit low metabolic activity, re- duced ROS production, diminished FBP1 level, and increased levels of mitochondrial antioxidant SOD2 and anti-apoptotic proteins Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL. Ectopic expression of FBP1 (a) suppresses glycolysis; (b) de- creases levels of SOD2; (c) restores capacity of generating ROS; (d) de- creases levels of Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL; and (e) reduces levels of Notch1 and p21, diminishing stemness. FBP1 functions both as an enzyme of glyco- genesis in maintenance of low glucose metabolism and as a tumor sup- pressor in maintenance of both low ROS level and high self-renewal, contributing to tumorigenesis of Cr(VI)-transformed cells.

Kushida et al. / Toxicology and Applied Pharmacology 208 (2005) 285\u2013294 293 In conclusion, the present study provided further evidence that a low dose of DDT can inhibit the formation of both preneoplastic and neoplastic lesions in the rat liver, in an initiation\u2013promotion model, the dose-response curve showing a J-shape (hormetic phenomenon). Since few spontaneous liver neoplasms develop in rats, the inhibitory effects of low dose DDT may only be evident after initiation. Fig. 3 summarizes the dose\u2013response curves of the parameters we analyzed. The results indicate that the observed changes are biologically meaningful, also suggest- ing possible mechanisms underlying the inhibitory/promo- tional effect of DDT on hepatocarcinogenesis. In particular, change of 8-OHdG formation and expression of HNF-1a may be involved. For improvement of risk assessment, we need to accumulate more data for such parameters with low dose carcinogen treatment and to use an adequate model and sufficient numbers of samples enough to evaluate low dose effects accurately.

The most notable effects of NM on lung function occurred 14 d post exposure, when histologic evidence of tissue injury and fibrosis were most prominent. At this time, there was significant tissue consolidation, which we predicted would produce a loss of total lung compliance and indeed, this is what we observed. Of note, NM- induced loss of total lung compliance was most pronounced at high PEEP, indicating a failure of parenchymal recruitment. This is sup- ported by our findings that tissue elastance increased after NM, a re- sponse that was also most pronounced at high PEEP. In contrast, static compliance, which is determined primarily by the elastic properties of the tissue, was reduced in NM-treated mice at all levels of PEEP. Importantly, in accord with histological evidence of inflammation and injury resolution at 28 d, changes in lung function were at control levels at this time. In summary, the present studies show that pulmonary exposure of mice to NM causes an early inflammatory response at 1 d and 3 d fol- lowed by fibrosis at 14 d which was mostly resolved by 28 d. These changes were correlated with time-related aberrations in lung function. This mouse model of mustard lung injury will be particularly useful for mechanistic studies, as murine reagents and transgenic animals are readily available. These studies will be important in the development of therapeutics aimed at treating mustard-induced pulmonary toxicity.

It is able to alter the expression of CHOP at the protein level, which is related to endoplasmic reticulum stress signaling. Furthermore, it is also able to inhibit inflammation by reducing the induction of iNOS and the produc- tion of nitrotyrosine. This occurs via an inactivation of the p38/MAPK pathway and a reduction in the protein levels of CHOP. This, in turn, seems to bemediated via Akt and GSK-3\u03b2. In addition, our findings pro- vide further insights into the mechanisms by whichmagnolol exerts its beneficial effects on the injured brain (Fig. 6). Finally, our findings sug- gest that magnolol is a promising agent that may help bring about neu- roprotection and reduce ischemic brain damage.

With a clearer understanding as to the patterns of exposure to these genotoxic compounds and who are at risk, it may be possible to initiate preventive or corrective measures so that the health risks from exposure to traffic- related pollution can be reduced.

Since MT-1/2-deficient mice were not affected by Zn treatment, the protective effect wasmainly caused by the induction of MT protein expression in hepatocytes. The slightly higher GSH levels observed in ZnCl2-treated animals may have also contributed to the protection. The induction of MT did not affect themetabolic activation of APAP but attenuated the oxidant stress. However, lower hepatic GSSG levels after APAP and no evidence that MT was able to scavenge ROS in vitro suggested a target upstream of mitochondria. MT was able to effectively react with NAPQI once GSH was depleted. Thus, our data are consistent with the conclusion that MT acts as a second line of defense behind GSH to scavenge NAPQI and prevent the binding to cellular proteins including mitochondrial proteins. This will attenuate the mitochondrial oxidant stress and peroxynitrite formation, which are critical mediators of APAP-induced liver injury. Since MT can be induced by various cellular stresses, it could be target for drug toxicity prophylaxis. As such, MT expression could also be an unrecognized mechanism of protection of certain interventions such as a neutro- penia antibody (Jaeschke and Liu, 2007).

DON- and anisomycin-induced rRNA cleavage requires prior sequential activation of PKR/Hck, p38, p53 and caspases, while SG and ricin activated p53 and caspases did not. Future work should focus on clarifying the mechanisms by which lysosome membrane integrity is disrupted leading to the release of ca- thepsins aswell as the exact roles of cathepsin L in induction of apoptosis and rRNA cleavage. It will be of further interest to understand crosstalk that exists between lysosome-dependent and caspase-dependent apo- ptotic pathways and to identify the executing RNases specifically cleav- ing rRNA. Additionally, it will be necessary to determine how SG and ricin activates p53. Ultimately, in vivo studies of the ribotoxin-induced apoptosis-associated rRNA cleavagewill be essential to establish the sys- temic biological significance of rRNA cleavage to immune dysfunction.

VEGF controls the early phases of new blood vessel formation; however, VEGF also increases vascu- lar permeability and inflammation during this process (Croll et al., 2004), particularly in the formative stages when angiogenic vessels are leaky (Schoch et al., 2003). Ang-1 is produced by non- endothelial cells and contributes to vascular stability. Ang-1 binds to the tyrosine kinase receptor Tie-2 and induces Tie2 phosphoryla- tion, which is essential for vasculogenesis, maintaining vascular en- dothelial integrity as well as controlling the maturation and stability of new blood vessels (Iurlaro et al., 2003). Ang-1 also has anti-permeability and anti-inflammatory functions (Eklund and Olsen, 2006). CD31 is a cell surface protein on major cell types asso- ciated with the vascular compartment, including platelets, leuko- cytes and endothelial cells and has been used as a specific marker for endothelial cells (Delisser et al., 1997). Previously, we confirmed that Curculigoside A significantly enhanced Ang1 and Tie2 expression and is capable of enhancing tube formation and im- proving vascular stability. Expression of CD31, Ang1 and Tie2 was also increased by Curculigoside A and counteracted by the CREB in- hibitor, Cyclosporine A. Treatment with Curculigoside A also im- proved recovery of neurologic function and inhibited BBB leakage, effects that were counteracted by Cyclosporine A in cerebral ische- mia and reperfusion injured rats. In conclusion, Curculigoside A in- duces cell proliferation and angiogenesis through the Wnt5a/\u03b2- catenin and VEGF/CREB/Egr-3/VCAM-1 signaling axis and promotes maturation and stability of new blood vessels via increasing Ang1 and Tie-2 expression.

In addition, MC inhibited TNF-\u03b1 expression and MAP kinase activation, the latter being a cri- tical signaling event for TNF-\u03b1 production. The results suggest that MC may be used to treat various acute and chronic IgE- mediated allergic diseases. However, since we utilized the entire extract, the active ingredients that exhibit the anti-allergic ac- tivity were not revealed, and the dose studied was relatively high for application in humans. Further studies are required to determine the components of MC that are responsible for the anti-allergic activity.

Relative production of 1\u2032,6-(OH)2 BBR in DRLMs and HLMs. After microsomal incubation with BBR (54 \u03bcM) in DRLMs and HLMs (1 mg of protein/ml), BBR metabolites were measured by LC\u2013MS/MS. BBR metabolites (1\u2032-OH BBR, 1\u2032,6-(OH)2 BBR, and 6-OH BBR) were identified by characteristic MS/MS patterns (Table 1). Data for eachmetabolite were normalized to the ion peak intensity obtained with DRLMs (30 min). *p b 0.05 vs. control. Results are mean \u00b1 SD (n = 3). 17M. Shirakawa et al. / Toxicology and Applied Pharmacology 288 (2015) 12\u201318 the relative production of 1\u2032,6-(OH)2 BBR in DRLMs (30 min) and HLMs (30 and 80 min) (Fig. 8) were comparable to that of the metabolism- dependent MPT induction (Fig. 7). These results strongly support a previous finding whereby dihydroxylated BBR (1\u2032,6-(OH)2 BBR) pro- duced by CYP3A may be involved in BBR-induced hepatotoxicity in humans (Kobayashi et al., 2012). Moreover, our assay system can easily evaluate interspecies differences in the quality and quantity of toxic metabolite formation resulting in mitochondrial perturbation. To predict DILI associated with mitochondrial dysfunction, it is essential to consider interspecies differences in parent drug- or TM-induced mitochondrial dysfunction. Mitochondrial dysfunction is a major mechanism of DILI (Labbe et al., 2008; Pessayre et al., 2010, 2012), particularly, as a loss of membrane impermeability to protons is associated with mitochondrial cell death pathways, and MPT is thought to be a key event in this process (Castilho et al., 1995; Kowaltowski et al., 2001). Our assay requires liver mitochondria freshly isolated from healthy donors, but it is not practical. Consequently, we need to use other options such as mitochondria isolated from the liver of other animal species. We previously reported that monkey and rat mitochondria are more susceptible to MPT induction than mouse mitochondria to certain compound, and this interspecies dif- ference could be explained by differences in the expression level of cyclophilin D, a component of the MPT pore protein (Sekine et al., 2013). Interspecies differences in the susceptibility of mitochondria to MPT inducers should be noted when extrapolating the data to human situation. In conclusion, we successfully demonstrated that TMs of BBR direct- ly induced MPT by using a novel in vitro sequential assay system. This system may be useful for a comprehensive evaluation of metabolite- dependent MPT without identifying or purifying the responsible metabolites.

Further knowledge of the functional role of TCE in promoting these behaviors is warranted. Additional studies to study the impact of targeted dietary interven- tion to circumvent these metabolic and behavioral alterations could potentially lead to novel therapies with real clinical value.

Studies on a PBPK model of herbicides in pregnant humans have not been reported. Therefore, the model we developed may be applied to other herbicides since this model is simple and the parameters re- quired are low. Additional studies examining the in vitro toxicology of flumioxazin, particularly assessing teratogenicity, would be useful and the PBPKmodel developed in this study could be helpful in determining the concentration of flumioxazin in such experiments.

For example, dietary butylated hydroxytoulene (BHT) protects against AFB1-associated symptoms in turkeys, in part, due to its inhibitory effect on P450 1A5, exhibiting Michaelis\u2013Menten competitive inhibition kinetics (Ki=0.81 \u03bcM) (Guarisco et al., 2008). Guarisco et al. (2008) also showed that BHT induces P450 3A, which implies that this enzyme is probably not bioactivating AFB1in vivo; rather, it may be contributing to the protective effects of BHTbypossible detoxification to AFQ1. In conclusion, the present study provides strong evidence that the dominant catalyst of AFB1 epoxidation at low, environmentally-relevant concentrations found in poultry liver is P450 1A5.

Henderson et al. / Toxicology and Applied Pharmacology 233 (2008) 420\u2013427 The results from this study raise some issues to be addressed in future studies. Do individuals expressing active FMO (at least one FMO2\u204e1 allele, a genotype present at high incidence in regions of Africa where TB is epidemic (Phillips and Shephard, 2008) in lung exhibit therapeutically or toxicologically distinct responses to ETA compared to individuals of the FMO2\u204e2/2\u204e2 genotype? Does FMO oxygenation in lung cells enhance or reduce the therapeutic efficacy of EtaA-dependent bioactivation of the prodrug ETA in the M. tubercu- losis organism? These are important questions to address as second- line TB drugs, such as ETA, become increasingly important in treating multi-drug resistant M. tuberculosis.

References", "Compliance with ethical standards": "The extracellular matrix components, majorly collagen and elastin determine the passive elastic properties of large elastic conduit (con- ducting) arteries like aorta. Elastin provides compliance (elasticity) during cardiac systole and collagen renders strength to prevent failure of aorta at high pressure (Wagenseil and And Mecham, 2012). Both DOCA-Salt (DS) and UNX-DOCA-Salt (UDS) groups exhibited significant surge of collagen/elastin ratio, a more reliable measure of vascular stiffness than collagen and elastin considered alone, which in turn is a significant predictor of hypertension (Dodson et al., 2013). In tunica media, high dose of metformin restored this ratio. Anti-inflammatory role of microRNA-146a is well demonstrated i.e. miR-146a reduces pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-6, IL-1\u03b2, IL-18, NF- \u03baB, macrophage inflammatory protein 2 (MIP-2), monocyte chemoat- tractant protein 1 (MCP-1), tumor necrosis factor (TNF-\u03b1), plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) in the model of diabetic nephropathy (Xu et al., 2012; Bhatt et al., 2015). MicroRNA-146a targets TRAF6 (TNF receptor-associated factor 6), which plays a crucial role in the activa- tion of AKT signalling and thereby exhibits anti-hypertrophic effects (Sharma et al., 2014). We also observed decreased expression of miR- 146a in the heart of UDS animals. Treatment with metformin restored the expression of miR-146a, suggesting that metformin alleviates car- diac hypertrophy by altering miRNA-146a. MicroRNAs-155 (Yamanaka et al., 2009) and -99b (Jin et al., 2013) are involved in regulating cardiac hypertrophy via involvement of AKT. Increased p-AKT is re- sponsible for pathological cardiac hypertrophy (Wende et al., 2014). Our results show that miR-155, which upregulates AKT was increased and miR-99b, which downregulates AKT was significantly decreased in UDS group. Expression of these microRNAs got restored by treatment with metformin, indicating the anti-hypertrophic role of metformin. These observations further support the histopathological data of fi- brosis, a cardinal feature of hypertrophy of heart. MicroRNA-451, is involved in the regulation of the levels of p-AMPK in glioma cells (Godlewski et al., 2010). We also observed an inverse relationship be- tween the levels of miRNA-451 and that of the expression of p-AMPK in our study. However, it was found to be statistically non-significant. This study highlights that metformin, an AMPK activator, alleviates hy- pertension-induced cardiovascular and renal dysfunction and confers cardioprotection by altering SERCA2, miR-99b, 146a and \u2212 155 in UNX + DOCA-salt model (Fig. 5).", "Acknowledgement": "Acknowledgements We thank National Institute of Pharmaceutical Education and Research (NIPER) S.A.S.
