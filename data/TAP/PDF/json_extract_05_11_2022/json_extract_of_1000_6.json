In silico or computer-based models take the animal as a whole, but often lack important, detailed information about distribution or uptake process- es. This information can be taken from studies with other organisms such as rodents, but that does not always seem to work because of the physiological differences between marine mammals and rodents. In the present study, the estimated elimination half-lives of PCBs in marine mammals were higher to much higher compared to the elimination half-lives of PCBs taken from the literature, probably because of the greater lipid deposits in marine mammals. For the brain, not only the lipid percentage plays an important role in the distribution of chemicals, also the lipid composition, together with a potential influence of the blood\u2013brain barrier, are determining factors for the bioaccumulation of lipophilic contaminants. Although more physiological background information of marine mammals (e.g. lipid composition of the tissues, enzyme-mediated metabolic transforma- tion) would enhance the extrapolation of the models from one chemical to the other, PBPK models are certainly useful. Once they have been developed, these models can be used for a broad range of applications, such as visualizing temporal trends or shedding some light on possible metabolic breakdown capacities and as such, they go further than simply describing the results of typical biomonitoring studies. As developed and used in the present study, PBPK models are non-invasive and non-destructive which is the only possible approach to study the kinetics of chemicals in marine mammals.

Previous research has established that ROS can play a direct role in the cellular transformation response by affecting cytoplasmic and nuclear signal transduc- tion pathways, such as the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway (MAPK) (Huang et al., 1999). Such work establishes a foundation to study the signaling pathways perturbed by both As (III) and MMA (III) via the generation of ROS. The question remains if MMA (III) and As (III) activate differential signaling pathways via different mechanisms of ROS generation in human cells, with As (III) producing ROS very quickly its oxidation, and with MMA (III) producing more severe effects at lower levels by first altering proteins.

The effect of rifampicine, asenapine, lurasidone and iloperidone on the CYP3A4 activity and mRNA level in cryopreserved human hepatocytes from three different lots. RIF \u2013 rifampicin, white bars \u2013 lot HU1832 of hepatocytes line, gray bars \u2013 lot HU1663 of hepatocytes line and black bars \u2013 lot HU1836 of hepatocytes line. (A) CYP3A4 activity level was measured as the rate of testosterone 6\u03b2-hydroxylation and pre- sented as the percent of control. The control values for CYP3A4 activity (pmol/mg pro- tein/min) were: 0.027 \u00b1 0.003 for HU1832, 0.059 \u00b1 0.013 for HU1663 and 0.017 \u00b1 0.007 for HU1836. (B) The CYP3A4 mRNA level was presented as fold change upon drug treatment (mean \u00b1 SEM, n = 5).

However, this study is a precocious screening and further work focusing onmolecular mechanisms and the role of various metabolites is necessary. Our data predicted that resver- atrol and apigenin might be good candidates for the development of new therapeutics, whereas daidzein and zearalenone should be avoided for breast cancer and neuritogenesis. Nevertheless, it is essential to con- firm the abilities of these compounds in animal models using rodents, for instance. Indeed, the antiproliferative effect of botanical estrogens could be tested in nude mice xenograft models, while the neuroprotec- tive and neurotrophic effects could be investigated after ischemic injury (Habauzit et al., 2011) or in mice model of Parkinson disease as it was recently reported for puerarin (Zhao et al., 2015).

Discussion Funding Conflict of interest statement Acknowledgments References", "Funding": "In conclusion, the present findings indicate that PentaCB-mediated decrease in serum T4 level in mice is mainly dependent on the increase in hepatic accumulation (promotion of the transportation from serum to liver and/or inhibition of the efflux from hepatic cells) of T4 and strongly suggest that in WT mice, PentaCB-mediated decrease in serumT4 occurs, at least in part, through the inhibition of a T4\u2013TTR com- plex formation by the hydroxylatedmetabolites of PentaCB. The present findings also indicate that the PentaCB-mediated decrease primarily occurs in a T4-UGT-independent manner. In addition, the clearance profile of serum [125I]T4 in the PentaCB-pretreatedWTmicewas almost the same as that in control TTR-null mice, conforming that serum TTR plays an important role in the maintenance of serum T4 level. Further- more, the serum level of total hydroxylated PCB metabolites herein found in the PentaCB-treated mice was about 400-fold higher than a previously reported level in Yusho patients (Masuda, 2009). According- ly, contribution of the hydroxylated PCB metabolites to disruption of serum T4 level in Yusho patients is not necessarily clear. However, the previous report (Feldt-Rasmussen and Rasmussen, 2007) and the pres- ent findings that constitutive level of serum T4 in humans, as well as TTR-null mice, primarily maintains a T4\u2013TBG complex (75% of total T4-serum protein complexes in humans), but not a T4\u2013TTR complex, suggest that the decreased level of serum T4 in PCB-exposed humans (Koopman-Esseboom et al., 1994; Persky et al., 2001) is, at least in part, attributed to the PCB/its hydroxylated metabolite-mediated pro- motion of the accumulation of T4 in several tissues, especially the liver.

Furthermore, DDT appears to be a weak inhibitor of p-glycoprotein function and induces an ER stress response. These data reflect on the potential toxic effects of DDT and suggest that it might affect drug and xenobiotic absorption by preventing efflux. The effects on the ER, such as induction of Bip, suggest the DDT may affect biogenesis of membrane proteins. Acknowledgments The authors thank Ms. Karen Ireland for technical assistance, and Drs. A.

As NAC has long been considered a scavenger of ROS and to protect the cells from the toxicity of quinones, this finding would contradict researcher's long-held standpoint. The dual nature of NAC's effect de- pendent on NQO1 activity will need to be considered when evaluat- ing the toxicity of quinone compounds in the future. In this study, we focused on only NQO1. Correlation with the activity level of other metabolic enzymes, cytochrome P450 reductase, AKR, etc. would also be a subject to examine in the future.

Using susceptibility to histopathological changes as well as treatment itself as factors for a toxicogenetic analysis led to the hypoth- esis that alterations in the protein ubiquitination pathway leading to accumulation of oxidized proteins in the liver may potentiate the liver injury mediated by this drug. While additional work will be needed to determine the validity of this hypothesis, findings from this project may provide insight into the mechanisms of toxicity associated with other antibiotics, and in the future contribute to the development of antibiotics with less liver liability.

Present study clearly demonstrates that pretreatment with cavidine reduces the mortality of mice during 72 h after endotoxin injection. In addition, cavidine administration signifi- cantly attenuates histological pathophysiology features of LPS-induced injury in lung, liver and kidney. Andalso that in thepresence of cavidine, there is an inhibitory effect on endotoxin-induced production of pro-in- flammatory cytokines in serum and tissues such as TNF-\u03b1, IL-6 and HMGB1. Furthermore cavidine's effects on HMGB1 may be related to p38 MAPK and ERK1/2 pathway. In summary, results of this study sug- gest that cavidine has potent protective effect onmice duringwhole en- dotoxic shock stage.

Through studies aimed at elucidating the mechanism of PM-induced EGFR activation, we show here that exposure to DEP impairs EGFR-directed PTPase activity in HAEC. These findings provide evidence for an initiating mechanism through which DEP exposure induces the expression of proinflammatory proteins such as IL-8 and COX-2.

It should be noted that the toxic effects on the ovarian follicles in this study are primarily seen at a high concentration of equol (100 \u03bcM), with the lower concentrations (600 nM, 6 \u03bcM, 36 \u03bcM) having no or minor effects. This is in general agreement with studies on other endocrine-active chemicals whose in vitro actions require concentra- tions higher than typically seen in plasma (Whitten and Patisaul, 2001). However, our findings are relevant to wildlife and livestock pop- ulations that are exposed to high levels of equol through isoflavone- containing pastures and commercial diets (Lindsay and Kelly, 1970; Lundh, 1995; Woclawek-Potocka et al., 2013; Woclawek-Potocka et al., 2008). Further, although human dietary exposure is close to the lower-range of concentrations used in our study (Setchell et al., 2001; Setchell et al., 2009; Setchell et al., 1997), exposure through equol sup- plementsmay be higher.Moreover, it is unknown as towhat percentage of equol circulating in plasma actually reaches the ovary, or whether equol accumulates in follicular fluid. This, coupled with increased soy consumption and the rising number of women taking phytoestrogen supplements, makes it important to understand the implications of equol toxicity for both humans and animals.

It should be noted that we compared mater- nal fT4 levels for each perchlorate scenario to no perchlorate exposure rather to a baseline level of exposure. Limitations of the model applica- tion include: 1) the lack of consideration of the effects of background levels of perchlorate; 2) the lack of consideration of co-exposure to other thyroid active anions, such as thiocyanate and nitrate; and 3) the lack of consideration for the contributing effects of other thyroid-re- lated nutrients in pregnancy dietary supplements. In order to address the first limitation, a controlled exposure-response study in humans and, if possible, in pregnancy with no or well monitored background levels of perchlorate is needed. In the absence of such controlled studies, our analysis provides a conservative estimate of the additional perchlo- rate exposure needed to cause a change in the central tendency of ma- ternal serum fT4 levels, assuming that the effects of background levels of perchlorate were already accounted for in the model. In regard to the latter limitation, the results of our work can be interpreted as the \u2018per- chlorate equivalent\u2019 total goitrogen load. We recommend that risk as- sessors who are interested in the contributions of perchlorate and other thyroid active chemicals compute the perchlorate equivalent doses of the other anions (OIG, 2010) and then subtract that estimate from the total goitrogen load estimate of 0.45\u20130.50 \u03bcg/kg/day. Efforts to characterize better the dose-response effects of other anions, such as thiocyanate, are currently underway in our laboratory (Willemin and Lumen, 2016) to evaluate the extent towhich one can quantitative- ly describe the cumulative risk of exposure to amixture of thyroid active chemicals. Overall, the current work offers a new perspective for the analysis of population-level data and provides risk assessors with a tool to demonstrate the feasibility of conducting scientifically supported risk assessment for perchlorate in sensitive life-stages.

Our current study has revealed a new mechanism, p53, by which FMO3 mRNA is upregulated by 3MC and BaP. Clearly much more remains to be clarified regarding the multiple mechanisms that alter FMO3 expression, particularly the reason why the highly induced FMO3mRNA does not yield a proportional increase in FMO3 protein.

The dependence can be attributed to the dominance of hydrophobic in- teractions between OH-PBDEs and TR binding pocket. Low-brominated OH-PBDEs are weak TR binders but TR agonists, while the opposite is true for the high-brominated compounds. Based on the molecular docking analysis, the difference in TR activity between low- and high-brominatedOH-PBDEs is attributed to the different binding geom- etry within the ligand binding pocket of TR. We hope that our study would help to improve our understanding about the mechanism of OH-PBDEs interference on thyroid hormone functions.

Even with the limitations of our study design, our results provided useful information for understanding the PMK-1\u2013HIF-1\u2013FMO-2 pathway as a mechanism of AgNPs-induced toxicity in C. elegans. Our study produced five important conclusions: 1) The prolyl hydroxylase EGL-9, which represses HIF-1 via VHL-1, can also act antagonistically to VHL-1 in response to AgNPs; 2) FMO-2 is significantly upregulated by AgNPs in PMK-1 and HIF-1 dependent manner, suggesting that the PMK-1\u2013HIF-1\u2013FMO-2 pathway is involved in Ag nanotoxicity; 3) AgNPs and AgNO3 induced pmk-1, hif-1 and fmo-2 gene expression and increased mortality in their loss- of-functionmutants, a findingwhich suggests transcriptional activation of these genes leads to toxicological consequences; 4) Toxicity of AgNPs and AgNO3 (i.e. increased expression of pmk-1, hif-1 and fmo-2, and increased sensitivity of their mutants) was rescued by treatment with NAC, a finding suggesting that oxidative stress was involved in their toxic effects; 5) Neither AgNPs nor AgNO3 revealed any qualitative difference in terms of exerting toxicity in the pathways observed in this study, however, in every endpoint we found, the AgNPs were more toxic than an equal amount of silver mass contained in AgNO3.

The protein encoded by the SIAH2 gene is an E3 ligase involved in ubiquitination and subsequent proteasome- mediated degradation of target proteins. Given that it triggers the de- struction of different substrates, including anti-apoptotic proteins (BAG1), transcription regulation proteins (POU2AF1, PML, NCOR1), and cell surface receptors (DCC), it therefore plays a part in apoptosis, tumor suppression, cell cycle, transcription, and signalling processes (Garc\u00eda-Limones et al., 2016). The correct expression of this gene is also involved in correct skin development.

Collectins, including SP-D, are soluble pattern recognition receptors belonging to the superfamily of collagen containing C-type lectins. Thesemolecules are thought to be major regulators of innate immune responses in the lung (Chroneos et al., 2010). Whereas in its native form, SP-D possesses anti- inflammatory activity, post-translational modification by reactive nitrogen species results in a change in SP-D to a pro-inflammatory protein (Guo et al., 2008). In the lung, SP-D is produced by type II epithelial cells, Clara cells, and submucosal glands in the pulmonary airways. Mice lacking SP-D show evidence of persistent pulmonary inflammation, including increases in macrophage numbers and size within the airways, increases in MMP activity, and enhanced oxidative-nitrosative stress (Atochina-Vasserman et al., 2007). We found that SM exposure resulted in a time-dependent decrease in native SP-D expression in bronchiolar epithelial cells which was directly correlatedwith inflammation and tissue injury. These results are consistent with reports that mustards damage type II cells and alter the surface tension of BAL, and suggest a potential mechanism leading to the development of acute respiratory distress syndrome in SM-exposed individuals (van Helden et al., 2004; Sinha Roy et al., 2005; Mukhopadhyay et al., 2008). Interestingly, SP-D staining increased in alveolar macrophages following SM exposure which was likely due to uptake of the protein by these phagocytic cells. Macrophages are a major source of reactive nitrogen species (Laskin et al., 2010b). S-nitrosylation of SP-D by macrophage-derived reactive nitrogen species may contribute to the proinflammatory environment in the lung following SM exposure. Administration of Curosurf surfactant, which contains SP-D, has been reported to reduce SM-inducedmortality in guinea pigs (vanHelden et al., 2004). These data suggest that SM-induced damage to lung surfactants such as SP-D may render the tissue more susceptible to oxidative stress, inflammation and injury. In summary, the present studies demonstrate that inhalation exposure of rats to environmentally relevant doses of SM (Willems, 1989; Eisenmenger et al., 1991) induces oxidative stress, inflamma- tion, and tissue injury, characterized by both apoptosis and autop- hagy. Although DNA and protein alkylation by SM are well established consequences of exposure, precisely how these alterations lead to pulmonary injury is unknown. Our findings that SM-induced acute lung injury is associated with increased proinflammatory activity of macrophages, autophagy in endothelial cells and anoikis in bronchi- olar epithelium indicate that different lung cell populations respond distinctly to mustard gas inhalation. These data are novel and suggest that multifaceted approaches targeting different lung cell populations may be an effective therapeutic strategy for mitigating the toxicity of vesicants.

Parathion caused astrogliosis that may be neuroprotective, while chlorpyrifos may affect astrocytes via its leaving group, thus abolishing the neuro- protection conferred by this cell type. The involvement of glial cells may at least in part explain the lack of correlation between AChE inhibition and neurotoxic effects between parathion and chlopyrifos and probably among different OPs.

Pocar et al. / Toxicology and Applied Pharmacology 322 (2017) 113\u2013121 Luborsky et al., 2003). It appears too that women occupationally ex- posed to phthalates during their reproductive life are at greater risk of POF than women of reproductive age in other occupations (Gallicchio et al., 2009). Grindler and co-workers documented a direct association between phthalate exposure and earlier age at menopause (Grindler et al., 2015). The DEHP doses employed were within the range of real environmental exposure in humans. Therefore, our observations of the dangerous effects of DEHP on folliculogenesis as regards reproductive performance throughout generations give reason for concern. In fact, al- though mouse data must obviously be evaluated very carefully before being extrapolated to the human fetus, folliculogenesis processes and blastocyst development are similar and phthalates can cross the placen- ta in both species. It is therefore reasonable to hypothesize that human fetal DEHP exposure during critical points in development might also act on follicular development and ovarian function. To gain more infor- mation on the potential for POF and infertility in the general population, further work is necessary to completely elucidate the mechanism of DEHP-induced acceleration of primordial follicle recruitment and the toxic effects on gametes after in utero exposure.

This hypothesis is diagrammatically pre- sented in Fig. 7. The data indicate that hamsters develop a urinary-distinct proteinuria pattern for GaAs and a different one for InAs that varies as a function of time for each binary semiconductor. These data suggest the possibility of identifying specific proteins in these patterns for GaAs and for InAs by blot transfer and N-terminal sequencing followed by the generation of antibodies and development of ELISAs for expedited evaluations. Hence applying these proteomic data for translational development of further molecular biomarker tests that may be used in conjunction with other approaches, such as the metabolomic studies described above for the heme pathway.

For example, MT protein levels in human liver without any pathology varied from 1 to 104 \u03bcg/g tissue, and a 100-fold difference in the mRNA levels has been reported (Wu et al., 2000; Liu et al., 2007a,b). Polymorphisms in the human MT-2A gene can limit MT expression (Kita et al., 2006). Low MT expression theoretically would predispose people to Cd toxicity (Nordberg, 2004). The susceptible population of Guizhou, China to arsenic exposure was shown to have reducedMTexpression (Liu et al., 2007a,b). Thus, inter-individual differences in MT could alter the susceptibility of humans to the toxicity of Cd. More research is required to test this important hypothesis.

Yet, as such assays only yield information on the distinct activities of the individual subunits of the toxins, they fail to yield comprehensive infor- mation on the combined physiological activity. We here describe an assay, which is able to monitor and quantify the entire sequence of binding to nerve cell receptors, translocation of the LC across a mem- brane, and LC-mediated cleavage of a SNARE reporter peptide. Although cell-based assays also allowquantification of BoNT physiological activity (Pellett, 2013), they often suffer from lengthy assay times and very high costs. In contrast, the in vitro system introduced here requires only little preparation time andminimal instrument requirements. Liposomes can be produced beforehand and stored until needed. Asmost reagents and consumables are standardized and available in high quality, transfer of the method into controlled environment would be feasible. The assay takes only few hours, including all incubation steps and fluorescence measurement. In conclusion, we demonstrate proof of principle for thefirst in vitro detection systemable tomeasure the three key steps in- volved in BoNT/B physiological activity at picomolar concentrations, without the need for animal testing or living cells. For a replacement of the animal test, the method needs to be tested with pharmaceuti- cal-grade BoNT-products and validated for its accuracy by evaluation of the exact detection limits, robustness and reliability by measuring inter- and intra-assay variations as well as unspecific effects of other compounds or similar toxins. Compliancewith international regulations need to be ensured. Furthermore, the test system's performance needs to be compared to other assays, which measure the toxin complete physiological activity or potency. Testing of other toxin forms, e.g. BoNT devoid of receptor binding domain (Fischer et al., 2008), will also be addressed in further studies. We believe that the nerve-cell mimicking liposome assay not only offers a tool to avoid the use of an- imal experimentation for toxicity measurements of pharmaceutical BoNT preparations, but that the modular character of the test system also allows an expansion towards detection of further BoNT serotypes and other toxins in the future.

NiONPs were taken up by BEAS-2B cells and released ionic Ni. The apoptosis induced by NiONPs contributed to the cytotoxicity of NiONPs. The intracellular accumulation of Ni2+ decreased the expression of SIRT1, which was accompanied by the hyperacetylation of p53 and overexpression of Bax. Based on the fact that reversing the repression of SIRT1 attenuated the activation of p53 and Bax, as well as the apoptosis, the repression of SIRT1 might be one of the key molecular events that underlie the cytoxicity of nickel-containing nanoparticles. The levels of SIRT1 may be a potential indicator of Nano-Ni exposure and may provide a pharmacologic target for the prevention of the toxic effects of Nano-Ni.

It is a natural constituent of petroleum-based fuels such as JP-8 with concentrations in the 0.1\u20130.2% range. There are many sources of naphthalene including engine exhaust. There are also many uses for naphthalene such as moth balls. Because of the extent of Air Force fuel operations, potential exposure is wide spread. The toxicity of high naphthalene exposures results in respiratory, CNS, kidney and liver effects, anemia and even coma. However, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Integrated Risk Information System (IRIS) Programhas targeted naphthalene due to positive carcinogenic results in rodent inhalation bioassays. As a result the classification for naphthalene could change to \u201c\u2026 reasonably anticipated to be a human carcinogen\u2026\u201d. The initial cancer risk assessment indicated 2 ppt as a potential new level for compliance. This would have a significant impact on the U.S. Air Force because its fuels would be branded as carcinogens. According to 29CFR 1910.1000, if a component in themixture is\u22650.1%, themixture is considered a carcinogen. There would be many environmental and occupational safety implications for the use of jet fuel and potential exposure to fuels containing naphthalene. Currently the EPA is waiting for new data from industry to address the carcinogenic issue in rodents that is driving the lowering of the standard for humans. Mixtures modeling and inhalation exposure characterization The individual components of JP-8 may interact with each other in the body, both on the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic levels. In order to develop pharmacokinetic and toxicokinetic models for such complex interacting mixtures and to characterize target site dosimetry for examination of dose\u2013response effects, a stepwise approach was proposed by the University of Georgia (UGA) and our laboratory. UGA will focus primarily on the kinetics of vapor and aerosol characterization and absorption, while our laboratory will focus on the development and validation of the complex mixture kinetic model for the fuel as a whole. The first step in the model development process was to build PBPK models for a number of representative components of JP-8. Suitable representative compo- nents have been identified as nonane and decane (representative of shorter-chain length, volatile aliphatic hydrocarbons), benzene and naphthalene (aromatics) and tetradecane (longer chain aliphatics). A model for tetradecane in planned. Initial models for nonane and decane were developed by our laboratory and UGA (Perleberg et al., 2004), respectively. Because of the similarity of these chemicals and some significant differences between the respective PBPKmodels, the models for nonane and decane were harmonized and are being published this year. Models and parameter values for benzene, toluene and naphthalene have been published in the literature (Haddad et al., 2001, Quick and Shuler, 1999, Willems et al., 2001). To date benzene, toluene, nonane, decane and naphthalene have been harmonized and incorporated into an integrated interaction model. Model refinements for naphthalene and validation studies in vivo are planned for this year by our laboratory. The goal is to develop a mixtures model that is predictive for JP-8 jet fuel. The model, after validation, can then be adapted to predict the behavior of the new alternative jet fuels of the future or a blend of JP-8 and an alternative fuel. References"}},

Further, although based on a small compound set, the assay also predicts changes in human contractility with 84% accuracy. The data also shows that the radioligand-binding assay does not need to be run in full concentration responsemode, butmay be run at a single test con- centration and that a reasonable estimation of pIC50 may be made, sug- gesting utility of this assay format in early drug discovery programs to screen large numbers of compounds. In a broader context, this data un- derlines the importance of the LTCC, not just in cardiac function, but that activity of a compound at the LTCC might also impact the vasculature, central nervous, gastrointestinal, reproductive and immune systems. A screening strategy emerges whereby single concentration radioligand- binding can be performed early in the discovery process with sufficient predictivity, throughput and turnaround time to influence chemical design with the ultimate goal of reducing safety-related attrition.

Ginsan inhibits bioactivation of CCl4 through CYP2E1 downregulation, which leads to the decreased formation of harmful radicals and ROS in concert with marked induction of its antioxidant capability. Ginsan may modulate inflammatory responses by decreasing the production of several chemokines, preventing infiltration of immune cells to the damaged area, and promoting the generation of hepatoprotective cytokines to accelerate the repair process. These actions of ginsan are of signifi- cant clinical importance, as abuse of alcohol or other xenobiotics damages the liver in a manner similar to this CCl4 intoxication model. While the extent of contribution of each mechanism is unclear, all responses to ginsan may provide a beneficial milieu in managing CCl4-induced hepatotoxicity.

More importantly, the current results demonstrate that resistance to arsenite is not simply due to decreased intracellular accumulation but rather to reduced susceptibility to arsenite-induced perturbation of mitosis and that this reduced susceptibility likely is a consequence of impaired spindle checkpoint function. These data also provide insight into the pleiotropic nature of arsenic toxicity. In spindle checkpoint-compromised cells, the increased arsenic accumulation necessary for cytotoxicity may target pathways that are not compromised by lower concentra- tions of arsenic.

The main issue is: should all fibers, short and long, be counted, or should only fibers equal to and or longer than 5 \u03bcm be counted to verify compliance with limit values. This question was addressed by the US EPA in May 30, 2003 in the report of the \u201cPeer Consultation Workshop to Discuss a Protocol to Assess Asbestos\u2013Related Risk\u201d. The panelists agreed that \u201cthe available data suggest that the risk for fibers less than 5\u03bcm in length is very low and could be zero\u201d. (http/www.epa.gov/oswer/risk assessment/asbestos/ pdfs). The following references published in peer-reviewed scientific journals provide robust support to the above reports of the US EPA and the ATSDR.

If these signaling pathways or key neurodevelopmental processes would be affected by a chemical at the concentrations re- levant to human exposure based on PBPK modeling, providing in- formation on internal exposures at the target site, perhaps such in- formation could be sufficient to take regulatory decision, avoiding further in vivo studies. Depending on the regulatory context (e.g., risk assessment), such information could also serve as a potential trigger for further in vitro or, if necessary, in vivo DNT testing. This approach could be of particular importance in the process of \u201csubstance evaluation\u201d under REACH, relevant to the identification of a SVHC (Substance of Very High Concern). Currently, DNT evaluation may be triggered based on the symptoms observed in systemic studies where, depending on the tonnage level, a 28-day and/or a 90-day repeated-dose toxicity eva- luation is performed (e.g. OECD TG 407, 408). In case of chemicals produced or imported with volumes of over 10 t/y, repeated dose 28- day oral toxicity testing (OECD TG 407) is required and a combined repeated dose toxicity study with the reproduction/developmental toxicity screening test (OECD TG 422 (OECD, 1996)) is recommended. At volumes over 100 t/y, a sub-chronic toxicity study (90-day) toxicity study (OECD TG 408) is required, which can be waived under certain circumstances. Importantly, incorporating supplementary in vitro identified triggers for DNT testing would be in compliance with the REACH regulation. 6. Discussion"}},

NF-\u03baB signaling controls both apoptosis and cell proliferation not only via regulation of NF-\u03baB activity, but also via crosstalk with other signaling pathways (Perkins, 2007). Therefore, the work seems to suggest new promising targets for studies addressing mechanisms of induced teratogenesis.
