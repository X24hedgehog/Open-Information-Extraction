GdCl3 pretreatment did not inhibit the 1,2- CB-induced formation of GSSG, suggesting that the early ncreases in GSSG are KC independent. Therefore, we hypoth- size that 1,2-DCB induces two oxidative events in vivo. The rst, as investigated in this study, is the oxidative insult oc- urring from bioactivation of the compound by hepatocytes as videnced by increases in GSSG. The second occurs from KC elease of superoxide anion. The results indicate that bioacti- ation-mediated oxidative stress does not lead to overt necro- is, but rather, compromises the ability of hepatocytes to pro- ect themselves from the consequences of KC activation. learly, the hepatocytes of F-344 rats are more compromised han those of SD rats following 1,2-DCB exposure (i.e., earlier oss of GSH, greater intracellular oxidative stress, and en- anced peroxidative damage). It is likely that these compro- ised hepatocytes of the F-344 rat release factors that result in ctivation of KC and a more substantial inflammatory re- ponse. The increase in lipid peroxidation following oxidative tress may also have a function in activating inflammatory cells ince lipid degradation products (i.e., aldehydes) have been hown to be chemoattractants (Di Mauro et al., 1995; Muller et l., 1996). In summary, data from these and previously reported studies emonstrate that 1,2-DCB undergoes P-450-dependent bioac- ivation in both F-344 and SD rats. However, this bioactivation nduces an early oxidative stress that is greater in the F-344 rat han the SD rat. The result of this early oxidative stress appears o upregulate KC activity in F-344 rats. This enhanced KC ctivation plays a key role in the subsequent hepatic damage aused by 1,2-DCB administration. Further studies designed to xamine differences in the bioactivation of 1,2-DCB between -344 and SD rats and the mechanisms of KC activation will elp elucidate the underlying mechanisms of 1,2-DCB-induced iver damage.

The actions of gastrointesti- nalmicrobes have been reported to be associatedwith several biological functions such as energy homeostasis (Nicholson et al., 2012; Kimura et al., 2013), immune responses (Ivanov et al., 2009; Umesaki et al., 1999) and central nervous system functions (Rhee et al., 2009; Cryan and Dinan, 2012;Matsumoto et al., 2013). Although the benefits of bac- terial gut flora are well documented, the effects of metabolites of long chain fatty acids generated by gut microbes have been poorly under- stood. Owing to the efficient production of multiple fatty acid interme- diates through metabolic conversion by L. plantarum, the biological functions of fatty acid metabolites are gradually being uncovered. We propose that fatty acid metabolites generated by gastrointestinal mi- crobes are key players in the relationship between foods,microbacterial flora, and host health.

As others have shown that CYP1A1 contributes to ROS production in isolated liver microsomes (Puntarulo and Cederbaum, 1998; Shertzer et al., 2004b), our results suggest that this also occurs in human vascular endothelial cells. Finally, this study provides insight into a potential role of CYP1A1 in TCDD-induced hypertension and endothelial dysfunction in vivo. Future studies will use this cell culture model to investigate the underlying mechanism of CYP1A1-dependent ROS production.

Accumulated evidence shows that highly toxic dioxins reduce glucose availability, reflected by a reduction in the blood glucose level (Christian et al., 1986), suppression of phosphoenolpyruvate carbox- ykinase and glucose-6-phosphatase activities (Weber et al., 1991), depression of insulin secretion (Matsumura, 1995), and suppression of intermediary glucose metabolism (Ishii and Oguri, 2002; Ishii et al., 1997). The increased glucose absorption in the intestine produced by TCDD reported here seems to be a biological feedback response to combat the imbalance in glucose utilization. Further studies are needed to clarify the mechanisms governing the facilitation of intestinal glucose absorption by TCDD.

Cholesterol deposited in the artery undergoes oxidative modification to oxysterols. Exposure of monocytic cells to 27OHChol or 7\u03b1OHChol results in increased tran- scription and secretion of CCR5 ligands, like CCL3 and CCL4, which leads to a concentration gradient of the chemokines. Among the T lym- phocytes that are attached to cell adhesion molecules expressed on the activated endothelial cells, CCR5-expressing Th1 cells recognize the gra- dient and follow the signal of increasing chemokine concentration to- wards the source of the chemokines, whereas other subtypes of T cells that do not express CCR5 (Tregs and Th2 cells) do not respond, yielding predominance of Th1 cells in the atherosclerotic lesions. Since oxLDL in- duces expression of cell adhesion molecules on endothelial cells, there- by enhancing attachment of monocytes and T lymphocytes to the endothelial cells (Takei et al., 2001), existence of oxLDL will accelerate recruitment of Th1 lymphocytes in response to 27OHChol or 7\u03b1OHChol. Th1 cell homeostasis is regulated by dendritic cells (DCs). DCs direct the development of Th1 cells from naive CD4+ T cells with a help of interleukin-12 (IL-12) (Macatonia et al., 1995). Since oxysterols induce differentiation into DCs and expression of IL-12 is enhanced in athero- sclerotic plaques (Son et al., 2013; Uyemura et al., 1996), the possibility of differentiation of naive T cells into Th1 cells should not be excluded.

The Luc assay can discriminate between the agonist and antagonist activities of samples; however, contaminants must be extracted from the water samples before assaying. Furthermore, the Luc assay can detect thyroid system-disrupting activity that reflects in part the metabolism of the environmental contaminants in living cells and that exerted by environmental contaminants targeting cellular sites other than TR. In contrast, the TR assay is superior to the Luc assay in that it is simple and rapid to perform, and relatively low cost. The volume of sample needed for our three in vitro and one in vivo bioassays differs greatly (\u223c1 mL in the TR and TR assays, b50 mL in Luc assay and b500 mL in the Tadpole assay). The Tadpole assay would be a powerful in vivo bioassay to confirm the thyroid system-disrupting activity of the contaminants detected by the in vitro assays. In conclusion, a combination of the in vitro and in vivo bioassays will enable reliable screening and risk assessment of the thyroid system-disrupting contaminants with high fidelity.

Even though the tubulin gene expression level was downregulated in neurons treated for 6 h, overall, no significant downregulation of the actin, tubulin, and vimentin genes was observed. Hence, the loss of cytoskeletal proteins in neurons subjected to oxidative stress may not be due to a downregulation of their genes but may be due to a direct effect of free radicals on the cytoskeletal proteins.

Acknowledgments Discussion Conflict of interest Acknowledgments References", "Compliance with ethical standards": "Although significant effects of tHGA upon AHR were noted, we do acknowledge the limitations of whole body plethysmography in the assessment of AHR. The use of this technique as a sole indicator of AHR still remains under intense debate and in many instances confir- matory tests that employ invasive techniques to measure dynamic compliance and resistance have been advocated. Nevertheless there have also been arguments as to the validity of invasive methods since they may alter baseline breathing patterns. Further investigations upon the pharmacology of tHGAwill employ both non-invasive and in- vasivemethods to gain amore definitive insight of the effect upon AHR. It is also important to note that the present findings, in which all markers associated with inflammation were reduced following treat- ment, do not explain the exact mechanism of action and our discussion is speculative based on existing literature. It is also possible that lower cysLTs in the tHGA groups are not measures of inhibitor activity, but generalmarkers of inflammation that trackwith the others.We are cur- rently investigating the mechanism of action of tHGA through dissec- tion of major proinflammatory pathways in both cellular and animal models. In conclusion, we have demonstrated that our previous findings regarding tHGA's inhibitory effects upon cysLT synthesis in vitro can be extended and confirmed in a standard acutemodel of murine allergic airway inflammation. Doses of 2 mg/kg and above are effective in alleviating all common parameters of pulmonary dysfunction in the above model and it is possible that these effects are due solely to the inhibition of 5-LO enzyme activity and subsequent synthesis of cysLTs. Further evaluation of tHGA in terms of its effects upon other proinflammatory mediators and their signaling pathways including evaluation of tHGA in both inhalatory and oral dosage forms is envisioned. Current experiments are evaluating effects of tHGA upon tissue remodeling in chronic models that better mimic human asthma.", "Acknowledgement": "Acknowledgments We thank Zulkhairi Zainol and Norasyikin Salim for excellent tech- nical assistance.

The concentration of formaldehyde reaching distant sites, in particular the bone marrow, could also be determined by coupling the model presented here to a PBPK model describing the systemic organs. To do this would require parameter values which are currently unavailable in the literature (for example, rates of binding and metabolism for HCHO in each of the relevant organs) and hence predictions could not be made to any suitable degree of accuracy. An important assumption in this work is that the increase in the concentration of HCHO in the arterial blood is negligible due to its removal by metabolism and first order processes during circulation. A PBPK model would be useful to ascertain the validity of this assumption. Acknowledgments The author would like to thank George Loizou, Martin Discussion Acknowledgments References"}},

Although a depolarizing shift in the voltage dependence of activation by D802K/G/A was observed, the degree of the depolarizing shift by different substitutions is not directly correlated with the level of resistance to deltamethrin (Fig. 3). In theory, accelerated deactivation kinetics by the D802K mutation could counteract the inhibition of deactivation by pyrethroids and render the sodium channel pyre- throid-resistant. However, the D802G mutation slowed the deactiva- tion kinetics, suggesting that there is a deactivation-independent mechanism. We hypothesize that D802 likely interacts with negative charges in IIS4 and modulates the transmembrane movement of IIS4. Disruption of such interactions may lead to altered channel gating which is unfavorable for the action of pyrethroids. Identification of alterations in the interactions between a negative residue in IIS1 and positive residues in IIS4 and their effect on pyrethroid activity should help uncover the gating state(s) that promotes pyrethroid action.

Discussion Acknowledgments Conflict of interest References", "Acknowledgement": "In summary, our result collectively indicate that cryptotanshinone, a natural topo 2a inhibitor, has a potent anti-tumor effect in mice, but does not show adverse effects outside of the nude mouse xenograft tumor system as tested. It remains possible that the observed down- regulation of topo 2a could reflect some cryptotanshinone-induced ap- optotic process. Thus, further studies are needed to elucidate themolec- ular mechanisms underlying the anticancer effects of cryptotanshinone, including the upstream signaling partners of this agent and the poten- tial involvement of topo 2a in the induction of cancer-cell apoptosis. In the future, preclinical and clinical trials of cryptotanshinone will also be needed.

Similar to CR, lead (Pb) preferentially skewed na\u00efve T cells toward Th2 cells, and cAMP was implicated in this skewing (Heo et al., 1998). Additionally, like CR, the interference with host defense against LM by Pb did not appear until day 2\u20133 after infection (Dyatlov and Lawrence, 2002). Thus, psychosocial stress and metal stressor Pb may share common pathways, including oxidative stress and catecholamine. Pb and psychological stress have been shown to generate additive, syn- ergistic or potentiated effects (Cory-Slechta et al., 2008), and \u03b2-AR func- tions may be involved. \u03b2-AR regulation is suggested to be an important component of the link between psychosocial stresses and health (Euteneuer et al., 2012).

Immune stimulation was not observed four days after injection of Cr2O3 particles alone at all doses tested in the PLNA. The provisional LOAEL identified in this study for im- mune stimulation corresponds to experimental Co (254,700 \u03bcg/L) and Cr (111,400 \u03bcg/L) concentrations, roughly 2000 times higher than Co (113.4 \u03bcg/L) and Cr (54 \u03bcg/L) concentrations found in the synovial fluid of normal-functioning MoM hip implant patients. Taken together, under these study conditions, the provisional NOAEL and LOAEL identi- fied in this study indicate that normal wear conditions are unlikely to result in immune stimulation in individuals not previously sensitized to metals based on the estimated corresponding Co and Cr concentra- tions in the synovial fluid.

All animal studies were conducted in compliance with the Animal Welfare Act and other federal statutes and regulations stated in the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals (NRC Publication, 1996 edition). All procedures with animals received prior approval from WRAIR/NMRC Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. Four groups of Balb/c mice (male, 8 weeks old) received one of the following enzymes: (1) monomeric rHu BChE; (2) monomeric PEG-rHu BChE; (3) tetrameric rHu BChE; and (4) tetrameric PEG-rHu BChE. Each mouse received a single dose of 100 U of enzyme (143 \u00b5g of protein) by i. p. injection on day 1 (first injection) and 28 (second injection), respectively. Five \u03bcl of blood was drawn from the tail vein at 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 24, 48, 72, 96, 120 and 144 h and then at 7, 14, 21 and 28 days post each enzyme administration for the determination of circulating BChE activity and anti-rHu BChE antibody. The following pharmacokinetic parameters were determined from the time course curve of blood BChE concentration: MRT, maximal concentration (Cmax), time to reach the maximal concentration (Tmax), elimination half-life (T1/2), and area under the plasma concentration-time curve extrapolated to infinity (AUC), using a Windows-based program for non-compart- mental analysis of pharmacokinetic data (Laub and Gallo, 1996). Group means and standard deviations were calculated for all numerical data. Statistical evaluations were performed on pharmacokinetic parameters using a two-tail Student's t test. A value of p\u22640.05 was considered significant. Assay for BChE activity. Samples were assayed for BChE activity in the presence of 1 mM butyrylthiocholine and 1 mM 5, 5\u2032-dithiobis 2-nitrobenzoic acid in 50 mM sodium phosphate buffer pH 8.0, at 22 \u00b0C. The formation of product was followed by monitoring the increase in absorbance of 5-thio-2-nitrobenzoic acid at 412 nm using a molar extinction coefficient of 13,600 M\u22121 (Ellman et al., 1961). Activity was reported as U/ml, where 1 U represents 1 \u00b5mole of butyrylthiocholine hydrolyzed per min. Mouse blood samples were diluted 20-fold in water, prior to assay for BChE activity."}},

These results in combination with data previously published by Madsen et al. (Madsen et al., 2010a; Madsen et al., 2010b) indicate that there could be an elevated risk of sensitization when potential haptens are present in topical formula- tions containing lipid vesicles. Although, the size of the vesicles seems to be ofminor importance, further studies are needed before anymore generalized conclusion can be drawn. Subsequent, non-invasive visualization of hapten exposed human epidermis by TPM, revealed that the skin penetration of RBITC increased significantly from the ethosomal formulations compared to the Et:W solution. Together, the results suggest that the observed variations in the sensitizing capacity could be, at least partly, a consequence of differences in the local bioavailability of the hapten.

Lyn activity is known to be controlled through phosphorylation of tyrosine residues, particularly Y-508 (Gauld and Cambier, 2004). Our finding that Hg2+ alters the profile of Lyn tyrosine phosphorylation indicates that Lyn may be a pivotal media- tor of mercury immunotoxicity. Future efforts will investigate the utility of Lyn phosphorylation status as a biomarker for mercury exposure. We postulate that mercury exposure during specific win- dows of B cell maturation may affect immunity and self-tolerance by altering the way the BCR pathway processes signal responses. This can contribute to the fate of B cells and may have downstream consequences later in life by impacting upon the incidence of auto- immune disease.

Discussion and conclusions Funding Conflict of interest statement References", "Funding": "In summary, our study demonstrates that exposure to acrolein induces a variety of stress responses in hepatocytes, of which GSH depletion, oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction and the novel ER stress (in the absence of ER adaptive/protective responses) are crit- ical components. Moreover, our data also suggest that the use of antiox- idants and inhibitors in combination may be attractive therapeutic options for preventing acrolein hepatotoxicity. The findings in this study are relevant in multiple settings, including direct hepatotoxicity via environmental and accidental exposures to acrolein; in the use/ side effects of the anticancer drugs (e.g. cyclophosphamide); during the regulation of proliferation/tumor growth by polyamines, and in the case of various alcoholic and non-alcoholic liver diseases where acrolein generation/accumulation may be elevated. Further detailed studies on the toxic mechanisms of acrolein are necessary to determine the temporal sequence of events; whether one death pathway triggers another or whether they are all coordinately/concurrently activated; the relative contribution of MAPKs; the comparative susceptibility of mitochondria and ER; and the inter-dependence or cross-talk between cell death mechanisms.

Moreover, activation of Kv and BKCa channels seems to contribute more to the control of vascular tone in the aorta from lead-treated rats. Recently, using this experimental model, we showed that lead exposure increased NO bioavailability and reduced vascular tone (Fiorim et al., 2011). Our findings suggest that the acti- vation of K+ channels and Na+/K+ ATPase could reduce vascular tone in the initial stages of lead exposure that counteracts the vasocon- strictor action of free radicals. In fact, lead exposure, at low concentra- tions, could be considered an important cardiovascular risk factor and a serious problem for public health. Conflict of interest statement None declared.

The congener 2,29,4,49,5,59-HCB (TSA 5 67.39 3 102 20 m2) had a small effect on [Ca21]i (Voie and onnum, 1998). This structure\u2013activity relationship must be mportant in considering ortho-substituted PCBs and respira- ory burst. It can explain why congeners with a larger total urface area than 230 3 102 20 m2 are less active or inactive (Fig. 5). Another important factor raised in previous studies is the barrier of rotation (Brown et al., 1997; Olivero-Verbel and Ganey, 1998). As revealed in Fig. 6, there is a correlation between activity and barrier of rotation if the congeners of large surface area are excluded. But it should be noted that mono\u2013ortho-substituted congeners, with the exception of PCB 1, such as PCB 60, are active. As already mentioned, previous studies have attempted to correlate bioactivity and isolated parameters such as the HO- MO\u2013LUMO gap (Brown et al., 1997; Olivero-Verbel and Ganey, 1998). This was shown to have some importance in our study (Fig. 7). The studies are complicated by the fact that the respiratory burst activated by PCBs is a result of at least two different intracellular pathways, intracellular [Ca21] and activation of hospholipases D and C and protein kinase C, prior to the ctivation of the NADPH oxidase (Voie and Fonnum, 1998; oie et al., 1998). Thus, the measured response could reflect ultiple interactions of the PCBs and could explain why the redictive power of the model cannot be more accurate. It is also possible that a structure-specific relationship that is ncovered by the physicochemical parameters used in our tudy could be of importance. The congener 2,29,4,6-TeCB 50) is highly bioactive, while the congener 2,29,4,69-TeCB 51), with almost the same physicochemical parameters, is oderately bioactive. The congener 2,29,4,6,69-PeCB (104), ith a 2,4,6-substitution on one ring, is the most bioactive of ll PCBs. This indicates that optimal activity is controlled by a ery specific 2,4,6-substitution on one biphenyl ring that is haracterized by a low dipole moment orthogonal to the phe- yl\u2013phenyl bond of the first phenyl ring. This might be appro- riate for a receptor binding. In conclusion, it is possible to predict the activation of espiratory burst by PCB congeners based on a quantitative tructure\u2013activity modeling. The results indicate that multiple tructural requirements are involved in PCB activity and that he main structural requirements are moderate size, ortho- ubstitution, and high absolute hardness. In addition there may e a specific 2,4,6-substitution on one ring that produces op- imal activity.

According to the results of MALDI-Tomokazu OhnumaF-MS analysis, two molecules of falcarindiol were bound to one molecule of Keap1 (Fig. 2B). Although one of the falcarindiol-modified Cys residues in Keap1 is Cys151, the other Cys residue is unknown. However, we found that S-alkylation of reactive Cys151 residues in Keap1 by falcarindiol is essential for activation of the Nrf2/ARE pathway. Because falcarindiol is an electrophilic agent and would modify many Cys- containing proteins as well as Keap1, one of the most interesting questions is whether several biological activities of falcarindiol are determined by S-alkylation of functional Cys residues in target proteins.

In this context, the present study has another clinical implication of PCB in cardiac disease in that the frequency of arrhythmias can be increased with the severity of PCB bioaccumulation. Our present ECG data indicated that the PCB 126 can induce SQT, which is an established cardiac channelopathy associated with atrial fibrillation (Gollob et al., 2011) and one of the leading causes of visible sudden cardiac death (Templin et al., 2011). However, the shortening of the QT interval was revealed to be an imperfect surrogate marker of an increased risk for arrhythmic events. Nonetheless, the important aspect of our study is that the en- vironmental toxicants, PCBs are the potent effectors of the acute car- diac electrophysiology including ECG, ventricular action potential, and channel activity, resulting in toxic effects on the cardiac function especially in view of the possibly serious accumulation of the PCBs in human body.

Oatp expressions are low in new- borns, markedly increase after weaning, reached the peak at maturity and maintained at the high levels for a long-period of time. In rats older than 540 days, Oatps were generally decreased. In addition, there is species difference between rats and mice in gender-specific ex- pression of Oatp1a4. Oatp1a4 expression depicted a bi-phasic expres- sion during the development, which is also different from mice. All of these variations in Oatp expression could impact the drug disposition and efficacy, and could be a basis of drug interactions, especially in chil- dren and elderly people.

Discussion Conflict of interest statement Acknowledgments References", "Compliance with ethical standards": "It is hypothesized that the ceiling effect of allosteric modulators of ligand-gated ion channels has important advantages over classic orthosterically acting compounds or open channel blockers, because it offers a much larger safety margin when it comes to drug administra- tion and patient compliance (Hogg et al., 2005). A similar scenario may also be feasible for the hERG K+ channel. For allosteric inhibitors one might argue that when non-cardiovascular drugs (e.g. astemizole) are combined with allosteric inhibitors of the hERG K+ channel, their cardiac side effects might be diminished. On the other hand, when allo- steric enhancers are administered together with antiarrhythmic drugs such as dofetilide whose desired target is the hERG K+ channel, the therapeutic dose might be lowered, thereby possibly preventing ad- verse drug reactions such as TdP. Taken together, the discovery of allo- steric modulators for the hERGK+ channelmight open new avenues for treating clinical conditions related to the hERG K+ channel as well as potentially reducing hERG cardiotoxicity of other non-cardiovascular drugs by combination therapy. In summary, the present study provides evidence for the allosteric effects of dofetilide analogs on the binding of hERG blockers to the hERG K+ channel using both [3H]astemizole and [3H]dofetilide binding assays. LUF6200 emerges as an allosteric inhibitor with micromolar po- tency. Potassium ions allosterically enhance the binding of typical hERG blockers in concentrations that are physiologically relevant. Moreover, LUF6200 and potassium ions act at distinct allosteric sites on the hERG K+ channel, and these binding sites show positive cooperativity. In ad- dition, neither fluvoxamine nor PD118057 exhibit significant allosteric effects on the binding of two radioligands. This new information may be relevant for a further analysis of hERG-related cardiotoxicity and pro- vide novel solutions for proarrhythmic side effects induced by hERG blockers.", "Acknowledgement": "Acknowledgments We are grateful to Annelien Zweemer and Anouk van der Gracht for helpful discussions.

However, there is no data on the actual concentration of ultrafine particles in the blood after inhalation. Although we could not present actual concentration of ultrafine parti- cles in blood after inhalation, our in vivo, in vitro and cellular experi- ments consistently suggest that HSanghoon Park could prevent the proarrhythmic effect of PM mediated by oxidative stress and CaMKII activation. Ultrafine particle is much higher in our study than the physiologic con- dition. Our study cannot explain the relationship between air pollution and arrhythmia in usual condition. However, our study might help to explain the relationship between heavy air pollution and the increased arrhythmia and mortality. Autonomic dysfunction was suggested as one of important mechanisms of PM-induced arrhythmia (Devlin et al., 2003). However, because we used Langendorff-perfused model, the effect of autonomic dysfunction was excluded. In this study, we performed pharmacologic interventions at the tissue level, and the further cellular study will help to better clarify the arrhythmic mecha- nism of PM.

These findings provide new insights into the possible molecular mechanisms underlying the nicotine-mediated promo- tion of A549 cell proliferation. Nicotine interacts with a5-nAChR on the surface of A549 cells, activates the ERK and Akt signaling path- ways, upregulates HIF-1\u03b1 signaling, elevates VEGF, and thereby pro- motes A549 cell proliferation, angiogenesis, and invasion (Fig. 6). Our study provides some clues for the development of anticancer therapy for the treatment of tobacco-associated human diseases, such as nasopharyngeal carcinomas.

The prevalent granuloma formation at 30 days after a single nanoceria exposure and the increased apoptosis suggest the inability to eliminate nano- ceria, which is supported by our unpublished metabolic data, and that the persistent retention of the internalized metal oxides among the surviving cells is undesirable. The reported hepatotoxici- ty in rats that received one intratracheal instillation of nanoceria and the decline in cognitive measurements in rats exposed to diesel ex- haust nanoparticles, lend support to the issue of adverse biological consequences of xenobiotic retention (Nalabotu et al., 2011; Yokota et al., 2011). Hepatic damage induced by nanoceria in this study was indicated by the elevation of AST at 1 h and 20 h after ceria infusion. Decreasing levels of hepatic transaminases, and a well-maintained hepatic cytology offer hope that the observed hep- atotoxicity may be limited. The lack of organelle penetration by ceria ENM may contribute to the relative lack of long-term cytotoxicity and could allow this ENM to function as an intracellular free radical scavenger (Chen et al., 2006; Pierscionek et al., 2010). While indica- tion of similar health effects in the human has not been reported, our study, together with reports on nanoparticle-induced granuloma formation in the lung (Liao et al., 2008; Park et al., 2009), suggests a need for additional investigation of the potential health effects of nanoceria. In light of the increasing industrial, and proposed medi- cal, applications of nanoceria, the observed hepatotoxicity raises safety concerns and invites future discovery of novel solutions for the enhanced metabolic processing of this and other ENMs by hepa- tocytes, Kupffer cells and stellate cells.

Moreover, andrographolide interferes with preadipocytes entering into MCE by arresting them at the G0/G1 phase.

But radiotherapy and chemother- apy are often unsuccessful, because of acquired radiation and chemotherapeutic resistance of cancer cells (Zhang et al., 2011). These resistances are related to the lower expression of DRs, TNFR and FAS, and resistances are overcome by increased DR expression (Efimova et al., 2009; Maduro et al., 2009; Park et al., 2010c). The combined treatment of TRAIL with irradiation strongly increased ap- optosis in MDA-MB 231, HCT-15, Colo 205, NCI H460, FaDu DD and SCC-4 cells compared to treatment with TRAIL or irradiation alone through increase of DR expression (Kang et al., 2011; Maduro et al., 2009; Marini et al., 2005; Zhang et al., 2011). The combination of TRAIL and chemotherapeutic drug including cisplatin, doxorubicin, and paclitaxel also overcomes resistance to TRAIL or/and chemother- apy in almost all the ovarian cancer cells (Cuello et al., 2001). We found that bee venom and melittin enhanced tumor killing ability of several chemotherapeutic in a number of cancer cells through upre- gulation of DRs (data not shown). These present data provide that bee venom and melittin could be useful candidate compounds to en- hance tumor killing ability of chemotherapeutics through enhance- ment of DR expression.

Effect of bleomycin (15 mg/kg, i.p. three times/week) and methyl palmitate (MP; 300 mg/kg, i.p. three times/week in alternating days with bleomycin on histopathologic analysis of rat lungs stained with H&E and viewed at magnification 40\u00d7. Images were selected according to the alveolitis and fibrosis scores. A: Normal control rat showing clear alveolar spaces. B: Bleomycin administered rat showing collapsed alveolar spaces with wide focal area of fibrosis and emphysematous. C: Bleomycin/MP treated rat showing more obvious alveolar spaces with mild area of focal fibrosis. D:MP treated rats showing normal architecture of alveolar spaces.

El-Demerdash / Toxicology and Applied Pharmacology 254 (2011) 238\u2013244 bind to DNA (Wertz & Dixit, 2010). In the present study, upon LPS stimulation, I\u03baB\u03b1 protein phosphorylation was significantly increased by more than two fold. Treatment of cells with 0.5 mM MP for 24 hours significantly down regulated I\u03baB\u03b1 phosphorylation. Thus, MP could be categorized as IkB phosphorylation inhibitors. However, further studies are warranted to explore if MP inhibits IKK1 or IKK2. To explore the efficacy of MP in-vivo, it was examinedwhether MP will be effective in preventing bleomycin-induced lung inflammation and fibrosis. Bleomycin is a chemotherapeutic drug used clinically for a variety of human malignancies (Hay et al., 1991). As a side effect of its therapeutic use, bleomycin induces pulmonary inflammation and fibrosis mediated by activation of NF-\u03baB (Baeuerle and Henkel, 1994). Bleomycin-induced lung fibrosis is a widely used animal model resembling human idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (Moeller et al., 2008). In the present study, it was found that bleomycin causes destruction of the lung architecture characterized by focal area of fibrosis with collapse of air alveoli and emphysematous and associated with a significant increase in hydroxyproline levels (a biochemical index of parenchymal collagen content) compared to the control group. These results are consistent with previous studies (Arslan et al., 2002; Punithavathi et al., 2000). Co-treatment of animals with MP significantly reduced the hydroxyproline level in lung tissue and ameliorated the lung fibrosis induced by bleomycin. These results support the potential antifibrotic effect of MP similar to carbon tertrachloride-induced liver fibrosis (Rodr\u00edguez-Rivera et al., 2008). It was further assessed the activity of NF-\u03baB by immunohis- tochemical detection of activated subunit p65. In agreement with previous studies, bleomycin induced the NF-\u03baB activity in lungs, suggesting that pulmonary epithelial cells secrete NF-\u03baB p65 (Kalayarasan et al., 2008; Ishii and Takad 2002). Co-treatment of animals with MP significantly reduced the NF-\u03baB activity, a result that is complementary to the in-vitro findings. The in-vitro and in-vivo studies demonstrate that MP has a potential of inhibiting macrophages in general and promising anti- inflammatory and antifibrotic effect that could be through NF-kB inhibition. Further studies are warranted to investigate the clinical usefulness of MP. 244 E.

While protection against ofloxacin-induced mutagenicity is based on antioxidant properties of CE-chitosans, the genotoxic effect of AO was suppressed probably due to the interaction of CE-chitosan with the cell membrane of E. gracilis, which resulted in hindered access of AO to chloroplasts. We suggest that the results obtained indicate potential application of water-soluble chitosan derivatives, such as CE-chitosans, as antioxidant and antimutagenic agents.

This significant potentiating effect of apigenin on the response to 5-FU appears to bemediated through dif- ferent mechanisms involving induction of apoptosis (via caspases 3,9 activation anddown-regulating the expression of the anti-apoptotic fac- tor Mcl-1), autophagy stimulation, modulation of the JNK signaling pathway as well as ROS accumulation; resulting in tumor growth inhi- bition. Therefore, this work constitutes a basis for the putative use of apigenin as a co-adjuvant agent in cancer therapy. However, human clinical trials are necessary to evaluate the potential utility of this flavo- noid in the prevention and treatment of cancer as well as to identify its appropriate application conditions and doses.

Both the mRNA and protein expressions of cell cycle check point gene p53 and apoptotic genes (bax and caspase-3) were up- regulated while the anti-apototic gene bcl-2 was down-regulated in cells treated with silica nanoparticles. Moreover, co-treatment of ROS scavenger vitamin C significantly attenuated the alteration of apoptotic markers along with the preservation of cell viability caused by silica nanoparticles. This study suggests that the applica- tion of silica nanoparticles should be carefully evaluated as to their potential toxic effect to human health.

Replication blockage caused by mafosfamide involves ATM/ ATR that sense stalled replication forks and in turn activate Chk1, Chk2 and p53. p53 seems to be a key node in mafosfamide- induced apoptosis in lymphoblastoid cells, which up-regulates the expression of Fas and PUMA. A less efficient p53 independent pathway resulting in Bcl-2 decline can also be activated in response to mafosfamide. Therefore, it appears that components of both the death receptor and mitochondrial apoptosis pathway became activated. The finding that DNA replication blockage provides a more effective signal for apoptosis than transcription inhibition explains why non-proliferating cells are less vulnerable than proliferating cells during therapy. Furthermore, targeting of Chk1/Chk2 for sensitization of malignant lymphomas to cyclophosphamide (Kawabe, 2004) would rather cause resistance in p53wt cells, while this strategy would have no effect on p53mt lymphomas.

A brief survey has indicated thatmen residing in the north-eastern state of Assam in India chew 4\u20135 areca nuts per day, each nut weighing about 15 g. Since 7.5 mg/g arecoline is present in areca nuts, the total concentration of arecoline consumed by men (general average body weight ranging from 52 kg to 65 kg) per day amounts to almost 450\u2013560 mg, which is quite relevant to the dose selected for our experiments in the rat model. Arecoline has been shown to be a major cause of transforming oral epithelial cells (Y.Y. Yang et al., 2004) and generating reactive oxygen species (Nair et al., 2004), leading to oral cancer in several patients. Although the exact molecular mechanisms are yet to be unraveled, the findings in this paper reveal that although occasional andmoderate consumptionof arecanutsmaybe temporarily beneficial for male physical or sexual ability, sustained intake seems to be harmful from the point of view of morphological and functional transformationsof theprostate cells, rendering themenlarged andover- active. Such changes brought about by arecoline consumption may eventually lead to physiological discomfort in humans. The long-term significance of testosterone-induced hyper-proliferation of the prostate gland in response to arecoline intake, and in particular, its relationship to the onset and severity of prostatic hyperplasia in humans need to be elucidated further.

Airway resistance measurements followed this trend, although the difference was not statistically significant. NOS2 knockout mice exposed to OVA and administered nor- NOHA showed no change in airway hyperreactivity compared to vehicle controls suggesting that the effect of arginase inhibition on the development of airway hyperreactivity is NOS2 dependent. Non- specific inhibitors of the three nitric oxide synthase isoforms cause significant increases in airway tone contributing to airway hyperre- sponsiveness both in vivo and in vitro (Nijkamp et al., 1993). Previous studies by Eynott et al. (2002) have suggested that the NOS2 isoform contributes to the development of airway hyperre- sponsiveness, which seemingly conflicts with our data in which NOS2 is necessary for mitigating airway obstruction with OVA exposure. However, differences in the models studied may account for the differences in conclusions. We also note that airway inflammation and airflow obstruction may depend on the function of several NOS isoforms, including NOS2, as inhibition of the arginase enzymes and subsequent increases in local L-arginine concentration may affect numerous enzymes including the NOS isoforms and the synthesis of creatine, agmatine, polyamines, proline, and glutamate in the lung.

Acknowledgments Discussion Conflict of interest statement Acknowledgments References", "Compliance with ethical standards": "However, the only significant correlation we found between specific inflammatory cells and exhaled NO concentrations was with the lymphocytes. Mice exposed to ovalbumin also had greater de- creases in dynamic lung compliance and increases in total lung resistance after methacholine challenge than the air controls. We observed very faint bands corresponding to barely detectable arginase I expression, but found detectable levels of arginase II, by western blot analysis of whole lungs of normal, unexposedmice. Is this reasonable? We can answer this question by reference to findings by gene array analysis of lungs frommice. Arginase II mRNA is expressed constitutively in the lungs of normal Balb/c mice, while arginase I mRNA is beneath the limits of detection (Zimmermann et al., 2003), which is consistent with our observations by western blot analysis. Based upon the existing literature, which is predominantly based upon gene expression (mRNA) analyses, we initially hypothesized that under conditions of increased NO production (e.g. ovalbumin exposure) we would observe increased amounts of arginase, espe- cially of the isoform I, in the lung. Our results strongly implicate the presence of inflammatory leukocytes, especially eosinophils and lymphocytes, and pulmonary macrophages as major sources, directly or indirectly, of arginase I in the lungs of mice exposed to ovalbumin. We cannot, however, rule out eosinophils and/or macrophages as significant sources of arginase I in these experiments. The apparent statistical correlation between arginase I expression and lymphocytes, but not eosinophils, may reflect the relatively greater variability among individual mice in lymphocyte content at the 2-week time point (Fig. 1), thereby giving the regression model a wider range of values to work with. Arginase I expression in macrophages is known to be regulated by Th2 cytokines such as IL-4 and IL-13 (Pauleau et al., 2004). Thus, it is likely that alveolar macrophages contribute to the observed levels of arginase I in the lungs of mice exposed to ovalbumin in our experiments. These results suggest that the relative contribution of the airway epithelium to producing arginase I in our model is minimal. On the other hand, the large airways would appear to be a significant source of the arginase II we observe in the lungs of mice in our experiments, suggesting a relatively minor role, if any, for inflammatory cells as sources of arginase II in our model. The occurrence of arginase II constitutively in airway epithelial cells is reasonable if we consider another important role for arginase in the cell, catalysis of the synthesis of proline and glutamate, which play an important role in protein biosynthesis. Since we know that there is airway epithelial cell hyperplasia and proliferation in the ovalbumin model, it is reasonable to assume that there is an obligatory need for baseline levels of arginase in the airway epithelium (Li et al., 2001; 2004) and that this role is played by arginase II in the mouse. Arginase I is a cytosolic enzyme, while arginase II is located in the mitochondria (Grody et al., 1987; Li et al., 2001; Levillain et al., 2005). It is thought that arginase I is mainly responsible for detoxification of ammonia as urea via the urea cycle (at least in the liver); it has also been suggested to play a major role in the synthesis of polyamines such as spermidine and putrescine due to its cytosolic location (Li et al., 2001). Arginase II is thought to be mainly involved in synthesis of proline and glutamate via ornithine (Grody et al., 1987; Li et al., 2001). It thus appears to be reasonable that the arginase isoform responsible for biosynthesis of amino acids necessary for protein biosynthesis is expressed constitutively in the lung. We observed a statistically significant correlation between decreased lung compli- ance and increased content of arginase I in isolated airways, consistent with a relationship between increased airway NO production and increased lung compliance. We should note that the overall statistical model used to examine correlations between the various measure- ments that we used in this studywas broken down into subsets of data to examine individual interactions, raising the issue of how best to correct the resulting P values for multiple comparisons. We tested a total of fewer than 15 models in the analysis of this data. Since terms within a model are only analyzed if the model itself is significant, we do not need to correct for every termwithin everymodel. Therefore, to make a Bonferroni correction, we conservatively multiplied model P values by 15. For the lymphocyte x exhaled NOmodel, the P values are underestimated. Examination of Q\u2013Q Plots of the residuals indicated that the residuals had slightly heavier tails than the normal distribution. This would cause us to underestimate the true P value, and, as such, we should not claim that the baseline effect of lym- phocytes is significantly different from zero. It is different from zero for several of the experiments, and the effect is significant overall. To follow the dichotomy of Nassim Taleb in Black Swan (2007), we are in Mediocristan, where distributions are still well behaved, as opposed to Extremistan, where analysis based on normal assumptions breaks down. Surprisingly, the residuals from the lung compliance x arginase I model appear to be normal. The concentration of arginine within the cells of the large airways and within inflammatory leukocytes is an important determinant of the selective role of arginase versus nitric oxide synthase in its metabolism. The intracellular concentration of L-arginine in endothe- lial cells is thought to be 0.1\u20131 mM (Ogonowski et al., 2000), but this value is probably critically dependent on the arginine content of the medium inwhich these cells are cultured or isolated. Circulating levels of arginine in plasma fromnormal human subjects have been reported as about 94 \u03bcM, while the corresponding value in asthmatic subjects was 45 \u03bcM (Morris et al., 2004). The corresponding value in rat plasma is 83 \u03bcM arginine (Kitiyakara et al., 2001), and in mouse plasma is 90 \u03bcM (Mattson, 1998). There is no a priori reason to assume that plasma levels can be equated with intracellular concentrations, as arginine is actively transported into cells against a concentration gra- dient and there is strong evidence that different intracellular com- partments exist with respect to arginine concentration (McDonald et al., 1997). Our direct measurements of arginine concentration in tissue homogenates prepared from isolated, microdissected airways gave apparent values of about 13 \u03bcM arginine from mice exposed to saline aerosols and about 6 \u03bcM in mice exposed to ovalbumin aerosol for 2 weeks. In preliminary experiments we have performed at other time points, we see a smaller decrease in airway arginine concen- tration after 1 week of ovalbumin exposure, suggesting a progres- sive decrease over time, and a restoration of normal concentrations of airway arginine at 4 weeks of exposure. Thus, the decreases we observe in airway arginine content coincide with the period of maximal eosinophilic inflammation (Kenyon et al., 2003a), and recovery of normal airway arginine concentration occurs during a period of decreased overall inflammation, with a shift to a more lymphocytic identity. However, there are limitations to this experi- mental approach that are worth noting here.

Hughes et al. / Toxicology and Applied Pharmacology 249 (2010) 217\u2013223 linked to a higher relative risk of urinary bladder cancer (Huang et al., 2008).Although the urinary profile of arsenicalsmaynot fully reflect the pattern of arsenicals present in the uroepithelium (Hernandez-Zavala et al., 2008b), these results suggesting that formation of methylated metabolites of inorganic arsenic may be critical to tumorigenesis in the urinary bladder. Administration of dimethylarsinic acid to rats produces urinary bladder tumors in rats (Wei et al., 2002), possibly by the formation of dimethylarsinous acid, a highly reactive species containing trivalent arsenic (Cohen et al., 2002).Urinary bladder has been shown to be a site for short-term accumulation of dimethyl arsenic following exposure to single doses of arsenate, methylarsonous acid, dimethy- larsinic acid, or dimethylarsinous acid (Hughes et al., 2005, 2008; Kenyon et al., 2005, 2008). As found in the present study, repeated oral dosing with arsenate has previously been shown to lead to the accumulation of dimethyl arsenic in the urinary bladder of wild-type mice (Hughes et al., 2003). In As3mt knockout mice, treatment with arsenate resulted in concentrations of inorganic arsenic in urinary bladder that exceeded by at least five-fold the sum of the concentration of all arsenicals in urinary bladder fromwild-typemice. Administration of a diet containing 150 ppm of arsenic as arsenite has been shown to induce systemic toxicity and cytotoxicity and regenerative hyperplasia in the uroepithelium in As3mt knockout mice (Yokohira et al., 2010). Given the high retention of arsenic and the tropism of inorganic arsenic for the urinary bladder in As3mt knockout mice, it is likely that extraordinarily high concentrations of inorganic arsenic would be present in the uroepithelium of these mice. The results of that study coupled with the results of the current study of the kinetics of arsenic distribution and clearance in As3mt knockout mice should provide a template for future studies of the fate and effects of inorganic arsenic and its methylated metabolites. These studies should elucidate the kinetic behavior of arsenicals, provide a model system for the study of the action of specific arsenicals as toxicants and metabolites, and aid in the development of a biologically based dose\u2013response model for this toxic metalloid (Kitchin and Conolly, 2010).

(2004). We previously reported that, in children environmentally exposed to As and Pb, O2 \u2022\u2212 in activated monocytes was negatively associated with tAsU but positively associated with PbB levels. The disagreement between some results of the previous study and our present data may be due to the fact that the studies are not completely comparable and important differences should be carefully considered. Although both populations included boys and girls in the same age group, the most important and relevant difference between both populations was the exposure levels to As and to Pb; in the Pineda-Zavaleta et al. study (2004), children had lower tAsU exposure levels (tAsU ranged from 16.7 to 465.7 \u03bcg/g creatinine) than children in the present study (tAsU mean of 194.6, ranged 12.3 to 1411 \u03bcg/g creatinine); in addition, children studied by Pineda-Zavaleta et al. (2004) showed had higher levels of PbB (PbB mean of 20.2 \u03bcg/dL; and 65% of the children had PbB N10 \u03bcg/dL) compared with exposure to Pb in the present study [PbB mean of 8.44 \u03bcg/dL; 25% of children had PbB N10 \u03bcg/dL]. Thus, the exposure profile was the opposite, situation that could influence the effects of As on NO\u2022\u2212 and O2 \u2022\u2212 in activated monocytes. Concerning Pb exposure in the present study, statistical analyses did not show association of PbB with NO\u2022\u2212 and O2 \u2022\u2212, and the inclusion of PbB inmultivariatemodels of iAs and its metabolites, with NO\u2022\u2212 and O2 \u2022\u2212, showed that PbB was not a confounder or modifier for any of the evaluated parameters. Finally, this is the first study showing a positive association between As exposure and basal levels of NO\u2022\u2212 and O2 \u2022\u2212 in both PBMC and isolated monocytes, suggesting that As produces oxidative stress in circulating blood cells of children exposed to a broad range of As (from 12.3 to 1411 \u03bcg/g creatinine). Interestingly, in this study, only 5% of the children presented arsenic-related skin lesions, but this was not statistically associated to As exposure (data not shown), even though it has been reported that these are the first signs of exposure to As in drinking water, appearing after 5\u201310 years of exposure (Guha-Mazumder, 2003). In addition, the positive association between As exposure and O2 \u2022\u2212 production in stimulated monocytes suggests that these cells, and particularly their O2 \u2022\u2212 activation pathways, are relevant targets for As toxicity. The alteration in the stimulated production of O2 \u2022\u2212, involved in physiological conditions in the immune response against pathogens, could be a cofactor, together with other oxidative stress sources associated to As exposure, in the development of As-related pathologies, such as cancer and cardio- vascular diseases. Nevertheless, further studies are needed to evaluate the relevance of these parameters in a larger size sample and the current and long-term effects on the health of exposed children.

Arsenic activates NF-\u03baB, which results in upregulation of tumor necrosis factor \u03b1 and interleukin 8 productions in ECs (Tsai et al., 2002). Arsenic increases ROS generation, expression of monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 and interleukin 6 in VSMCs (Lee et al., 2005). Padovani et al. (2010) have reported that arsenic decreases liver X receptor (LXR) ligands-induced gene expression of ATP- binding cassette, sub-family A, member 1 (ABCA1) and inhibits reverse cholesterol efflux in macrophages. Our findings that arsenic augments Fig. 5. Involvement of ROS generation in SA-induced LOX-1 expression andDil-oxLkhagvasuren DamdindorjL uptake.

A total of 1 \u03bcg of the protein was subjected to western blot analysis to detect phospho-p6 control. After normalization to the \u03b2-actin protein, the bar graph values are calculated as des following SA treatment. END-D cells were treated with NAC (10mmol/L) for 1 h and incubate Dil-oxLkhagvasuren DamdindorjL (1 \u03bcg/mL) for 3h in the presence of both NAC and SA. Data are expressed relative to t as 100% (n=3). An asterisk (**) indicates a statistically significant difference (p b 0.005). the uptake of oxidized Lkhagvasuren DamdindorjL through upregulating the expression of LOX-1 in ECs add another molecular mechanism underlying arsenic- induced atherosclerosis. Many studies have reported the involvement of LOX-1 in the molecular pathogenesis of atherosclerosis in both humans and mice (Morawietz, 2010; Nagase et al., 1997; Sankaralingam et al., 2009; Tan et al., 2008). Recently, Karim et al. (2013) have reported that arsenic exposure is associated with the elevation of plasma oxLkhagvasuren DamdindorjL levels with the concomitant reduction of HDL levels. In this study, we performed a series of experiments using a single cell line, END-D. Thus, it will be of particular interest to use human ECs to examinewhether SA upregulates LOX-1 expression and/or enhances the cellular uptake of oxLkhagvasuren DamdindorjL. In conclusion, to our knowledge, this study is the first to demons- trate that SA upregulates LOX-1 expression through ROS-mediated activation of NF-\u03baB, thereby enhancing the cellular uptake of oxLkhagvasuren DamdindorjL. Our novel findings raise the possibility that arsenic exposure can promote the pathogenic actions of oxLkhagvasuren DamdindorjL by evoking an aberrant LOX-1 signaling pathway, thus implicating the pathophysiology of cardiovascular diseases. Further studies, including in vivo experiments, are certainly warranted and may contribute to a better understanding of the molecular basis underlying the increasing risk of atherosclerosis associated with arsenic exposure.

Many studies have reported the involvement of LOX-1 in the molecular pathogenesis of atherosclerosis in both humans and mice (Morawietz, 2010; Nagase et al., 1997; Sankaralingam et al., 2009; Tan et al., 2008). Recently, Karim et al. (2013) have reported that arsenic exposure is associated with the elevation of plasma oxLDL levels with the concomitant reduction of HDL levels. In this study, we performed a series of experiments using a single cell line, END-D. Thus, it will be of particular interest to use human ECs to examinewhether SA upregulates LOX-1 expression and/or enhances the cellular uptake of oxLDL. In conclusion, to our knowledge, this study is the first to demons- trate that SA upregulates LOX-1 expression through ROS-mediated activation of NF-\u03baB, thereby enhancing the cellular uptake of oxLDL. Our novel findings raise the possibility that arsenic exposure can promote the pathogenic actions of oxLDL by evoking an aberrant LOX-1 signaling pathway, thus implicating the pathophysiology of cardiovascular diseases. Further studies, including in vivo experiments, are certainly warranted and may contribute to a better understanding of the molecular basis underlying the increasing risk of atherosclerosis associated with arsenic exposure.

Our results add to a gradually expanding body of evidence that inter- individual differences in arsenic metabolism play an important role in arsenic-related disease, including lung cancer. Our findings also add new evidence that arsenic drinking water concentrations b200 \u03bcg/L may be associated with significantly increased cancer risks, especially in people who methylate arsenic poorly. Although the design of this study prevents us from confirming the temporal relationship between %MMA and lung cancer, the biologic plausibility of our results and their consistency with a variety of other research is evidence that our findings represent a true impact of MMA on lung cancer risks. Data such as these are important in identifying susceptible subpopulations who may need specific regulatory protection. Information on the particular toxic species of ingested arsenic may also help elucidate the mechanisms of arsenic-caused disease, which are currently unknown.

The DNA methylation changes in gene promoters emerge and progress over time, are linked to altered expression of the associated gene, and appear concurrently with the acquisition of increasingly malignant properties. Importantly, target promoter DNA methylation, associated gene expression, and the malignant pheno- type were stable in the absence of the arsenical. Taken together, these studies provide early insights into the dynamics of the DNA methylation changes at specific loci that occur during arsenic-driven cancer progression as well as to establish further arsenicals as epimutagens associated with arsenic-mediated carcinogenesis.

We also demonstrated that elevation of eNOS protein by inhibition of ubiquitin\u2013 proteasome activity or by stable transfection of eNOS gene could rescue PAECs from cytotoxicity by arsenite. This finding suggested a protective role of eNOS in arsenite exposure. Our studies presented new evidence that eluci- dated the molecular basis for eNOS impairment by arsenite and also provided a potential mechanistic basis for vascular dysfunction by arsenite.

The improved ability of the arsenic-treated cells to survive without attachment to substrate, a property seen in keratinocytes cultured from carcinomas of head and neck tumors but not in normal epidermal cells (Rheinwald and Beckett, 1980), would be expected to increase their metastatic potential, although such a late effect may be unusual in the skin. Further work will be necessary to identify the pathways by which arsenic recruits h1-integrin, h-catenin and other participants to increasing the prolifer- ative potential of keratinocytes.

Thus, arsenite could influence the stem cell target population for carcino- genesis through epigenetic means. Coactivator recruitment is also regulated by growth factor dependent phosphorylation (Zanger et al., 2001; Chen et al., 2007; Tsai et al., 2008). Phosphorylation and acetylation of AP1 transcription factors have also been demonstrated to affect coactivator binding (Narayanan et al., 2004; Wang et al., 2006). Since arsenite has been shown to impact EGF and insulin/IGF receptor signaling (Patterson and Rice, 2007), exploration of downstream effects on AP1 transcription factor and coactivator phosphorylation merit future investigation.

Although lengthened exposure to high concentrations of CSSP still caused sufficient stress to induce AhR-independent cell cycle arrest via the p53\u2013p21\u2013Rb1 signaling pathway, AhR-overexpressing lung adenocarcinoma cells exhibited higher proliferation and colony formation rates when recovery from exposure. Our results suggest that AhR plays a role in antioxidant defense and cigarette smoke- promoted clonogenicity in lung adenocarcinoma cells under the conditions of this study.

The activations of TLR2 and NALP3 inflamma- somes by ASD may be at least partially participating in this phenom- enon. These receptors may play an important role in the secretion of pro-inflammatory mediators for protecting the host from pathogen. Even so, severe lung inflammation enhanced by ASD causes lung inju- ry to the host. The hazardous effects of bioaerosols (biogenic parti- cles) and mineral dust on human respiratory disease are also becoming a public concern. Atmospheric exposure to highly patho- genic bacteria and virus-carrying particulate matters could present a significant threat to human health. The experimental findings in the present study may serve as a warning about the ill effects of airborne sand dust in the world on the human respiratory system.

In the dilution study, we determined that the toxicity of most binary PM mixtures (7 out of 10) followed the additive behavior described by either IA or CA concepts, whereas only one PM mixture (CIT + OTA) showed synergistic interaction by both concepts. This study indicated that different PMmixtures follow different joint toxicity concepts, IA versus CA; therefore, there is a need for testing both IA and CA concepts for the risk assessment of PM mixtures when the mode of action is unknown. The present study may also be used for providing an informative initial screening to determine interactions of not only the ten PMmixtures tested in this study but also other mycotoxin mix- tures prior to animal study to validate the joint toxicity behavior of PM mixtures in other target tissues and cells.

Conclusion Conflict of interest Transparency document Acknowledgement References", "Compliance with ethical standards": "Regardless of their potential interactions indicated by either toxicity concept with MDR in the present titration study, 7 out of 10 PM mix- tures were considered to have no significant interaction since they were in compliance with either of the two concepts tested in this study as shown in Table 1 (Cedergreen et al., 2008). The observed curves for the following mixtures (3 out of 10), including OTA combined with either MPA and PA as well as CIT + PAT, complied with the estimated curves by IA. In contrast, the joint toxicity of the PM mixtures (3 out of 10), including CIT + PA, PAT + MPA and PAT + PA appeared to be better represented by CA, since their observed curves complied well with the estimated curves. The observed curve of OTA + PAT complied with the predicted curve by both IA and CA concepts, even though it ap- pears to be more suited with CA concept. Although the joint toxicity of most PMmixtures were well character- ized with either IA or CA concepts, there were three combinations: CIT + OTA, CIT + MPA and MPA + PA, where their joint toxicity could not be described with either concept. The MDR values for CIT + OTA were calculated to be 1.4 and 1.7 for IA and CA concepts at their IC50s, re- spectively,which did not reach a recommendedMDR limit defining inter- action. However, it can't be ignored that the synergism for CIT+OTAwas observed with both concepts. Therefore, it seems reasonable to conclude that the mixture of CIT + OTA is likely to have a true synergistic interac- tion, at least with respect to BoMacs proliferation.", "Acknowledgement": "The Transparency document associated with this article can be found, in online version.

Ideally, these selected positive bench- mark compounds have translational effects and are known to cause nephrotoxicity in both human and rat. In this way, the sensitivity, specificity and predictivity of this ABST model could be calculated to demonstrate the usefulness of this new approach in preclinical drug safety assessment (Valentin et al., 2009). In addition to direct eval- uation of candidate drugs on renal hemodynamic function (GFR and ERPF), measuring excretion of a panel of qualified DIKI biomarkers in time-matched urine samples is particularly useful for earlier detection of concurrent minimal renal injury compared with traditional kidney injury markers, or that whichmay occur prior to the appearance of his- tological lesions. Measuring a panel of markers is particular useful since the response of individualmarkers may vary depending not only on the extent and site of injury but also on the mode of action of the specific compound under investigation. Our data support the value of DIKI bio- markers for improved detection of kidney injury and highlights the im- portance of employing a biomarker panel as opposed to traditionally relying on a single indicator. Furthermore, the real time PK profiling in the same animal using ABST provides a unique opportunity for true PK/PD modeling, which may allow for more accurate determinations of efficacy, safety margins and improved predictive capacity in drug discovery.

The results demonstrated that most of tested pyrethroids showed moderate to weak inhibitory effects against both CES1 and CES2, but deltamethrin displayed strong inhibition against CES1. Further investigation revealed that deltamethrin was a strong re- versible inhibitor against CES1, which could inhibit CES1-mediated BMBT hydrolysis via competitive manner but it acted as a noncompeti- tive inhibitor against DME hydrolysis. Additionally, both experimental results and docking simulations suggested that CES1 had at least two ligand-binding sites, while deltamethrin bind on the same ligand- binding site as BMBT. All these findings will be very helpful for the deep understanding of the interactions between xenobiotics and CES1. Conflict of interest The authors declare that there are no conflicts of interest.

In this first study to explore the association between As and hematuria,we have also shown that de- creasingAs intake among thosewithmild tomoderate exposure is asso- ciated with decreased incidence of subsequent hematuria. It should be noted, however, that risk reductionmight not be as immediate or signif- icant in individuals with longer term, higher-level exposure. Given these findings, it is conceivable that As-related hematuria may repre- sent an early, modifiable sign of adverse effects on the urinary system. Future correlation of As-related hematuria with clinical diagnoses and mortality data are needed to further define this relationship and inform population-level screening and diagnostic guidelines.

Furthermore, we highlight the pivotal role of p53 in B1-induced apoptosis and open up possibilities for improving naphthalimide-based DNA intercalators efficiency, such as adapting treatment according to p53 status and Bcl- 2 tumor profile expression. Given the strong relationship between apoptosis and drug effectiveness, reinforcement of p53 activity and/or abrogation of Bcl-2 expression could represent attractive ways to promote naphthalimide-based DNA intercalators-induced apoptosis and enhance cell sensitivity to this kind of treatment.

We show that BQ-123 can prevent PTB in the mouse model when administered several hours after LPS administra- tion, by suppressing the pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, and TNF\u03b1, and by increasing expression and production of the anti- inflammatory IL-10 via ET-1 blockade. It is our hope that our results can enhance the scientific community's understanding and appreci- ation of ETA receptor antagonism in LPS induced PTB, and its poten- tial use one day as a form of therapy for women with threatening preterm labor.

Chandrashekar et al. / Toxicology and Applied Pharmacology 261 (2012) 10\u201321 the augmented levels of the early inflammatory cytokines, TNF-\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2 and iNOS expressions that support the anti-inflammatory efficacy of BE. These occurred in parallel with attenuating the recruitment of MCs influx by inhibiting the expressions of COX-2 in turn decreasing the ex- pressions of MMP-2 and MMP-9 supports the anti-tumor cell invasion efficacy of BE. Further, BE treatment significantly attenuated the levels of MDA and OH by enhancing the levels of cellular antioxidants, justify- ing the strong antioxidant efficacy of BE (Fig. 10). Finally, we conclude that the potent anti-inflammatory, anti-tumor cell invasion and antiox- idant effects of BE are more pronounced when it is used as a successful chemotherapeutic agent against B(a)P-induced lung carcinogenesis in Swiss albino mice.

Doerge / Toxicology and Applied Pharmacology 254 (2011) 145\u2013147 exposure studies described below were comparable to discrete human populations: serum concentrations in rats fed the control and low dose (5 \u03bcg/g) diets are similar to those in human adults consuming a typical Western diet (b0.1 \u03bcmol/L); rats fed the 100 \u03bcg/g genistein diet are similar to human adults consuming a typical Asian diet (0.1\u20131.2 \u03bcmol/L or soy nutritional supplements (0.5\u20130.9 \u03bcmol/L, Doerge et al., 2000); and rats fed the 500 \u03bcg/g genistein diet are similar to infants consuming soy formulas (2\u20137 \u03bcmol/L, Cao et al., 2009). The higher levels of genistein aglycone observed in many endocrine-responsive rat tissues relative to the blood suggest that accumulation is typical and that similar tissue levels could occur in human populations. Placental transfer of genistein in rats was also examined as a possible route of developmental exposure (Doerge et al., 2001). Pregnant Sprague\u2013Dawley rats were administered genistein orally, either by diet or by gavage at doses of approximately 50 mg/kg bw/d. Concentrations of genistein aglycone and conjugates were measured in maternal and offspring serum and brain using HPLC with isotope dilution electrospray tandem mass spectrometry (LC/MS/MS). Al- though fetal or neonatal serum concentrations of total genistein were approximately 20-fold lower than maternal serum concentrations, the biologically active genistein aglycone concentration was only 5-fold lower. Fetal brain contained predominately genistein aglycone at levels similar to those in the maternal brain. These results showed that genistein aglycone crosses the rat placenta and can reach fetal brain from maternal serum genistein levels that are relevant to those observed in humans consuming soy foods and dietary supplements. Another study measured the internal exposures of postnatal day 10 (PND10) rat pups due to lactational transfer of genistein (Doerge et al., 2006). Conjugated and aglycone forms of genistein were measured by using LC/MS/MS in serum (PND10) and milk (PND7) from lactating dams consuming a genistein-fortified soy-free diet that delivered a dose of approximately 50 mg/kg bw/d and in serum from their pups at a time when milk was the only food source (PND10). This study showed that limited lactational transfer of genistein to rat pups occurs and that internal exposures to the active aglycone formof genistein are generally lower than those measured previously in the fetal period. These results suggested that developmental effects attributable to genistein exposure in the previously published chronic and multigeneration studies are more likely to result from fetal exposures because of the higher levels of the active estrogenic aglycone form of genistein in utero, although the possibility of neonatal responses cannot be excluded. A recent study determined the bioavailability of genistein and daidzein in Balb/c mice by comparing plasma pharmacokinetics of aglycone and conjugated forms following administration of identical doses (1.2 mg/kg genistein and 0.55 mg/kg daidzein) by either an intravenous injection or gavage of the aglycones vs. a bolus administration of equimolar doses delivered in a food pellet prepared using commercial SPI as the isoflavone source (Andrade et al., 2010). The bioavailability of genistein and daidzein was equivalent for the gavage and dietary routes of administration despite the use of isoflavone aglycones in the former and SPI-derived glucosides in the latter. While absorption of total isoflavones was nearly quantitative from both oral routes, presystemic and systemic Phase II conjugation greatly attenuated internal exposures to the receptor-active aglycone isoflavones. These results show that SPI, a major form of soy used in the manufacture of food and infant formula, is an efficient isoflavone delivery vehicle capable of providing significant proportions of the total dose into the circulation in the active aglycone form for distribution to receptor-bearing tissues and subsequent pharmaco- logical effects that determine possible health benefits and/or risks. Thesepublished toxicology and exposure assessments of rats treated with dietary genistein demonstrate clearly adverse effects from chronic (e.g., increased incidences of mammary adenoma/carcinoma in females) and developmental exposures (e.g., accelerated reproductive senescence in females and increased incidences ofmammary adenoma/ carcinoma in females). In addition, plasmameasurements in the dietary genistein-treated group rats show that these doses produce circulating levels, and presumably tissue levels, that are similar to identifiable humans groups. Of particular note are babies consuming their entire nutritional input from soy infant formula. The circulating levels in these infants overlap the range of serum concentrations measured in rats consuming the high dose of genistein, for which the aforementioned adverse effects were observed. The very low margin of exposure between doses of genistein that produce demonstrably adverse effects in experimental animal models and those in 20\u201325% of all formula-fed children in the United States suggests that the possibility of adverse effects should be considered.

Doerge / Toxicology and Applied Pharmacology 254 (2011) 145\u2013147 exposure studies described below were comparable to discrete human populations: serum concentrations in rats fed the control and low dose (5 \u03bcg/g) diets are similar to those in human adults consuming a typical Western diet (b0.1 \u03bcmol/L); rats fed the 100 \u03bcg/g genistein diet are similar to human adults consuming a typical Asian diet (0.1\u20131.2 \u03bcmol/L or soy nutritional supplements (0.5\u20130.9 \u03bcmol/L, Doerge et al., 2000); and rats fed the 500 \u03bcg/g genistein diet are similar to infants consuming soy formulas (2\u20137 \u03bcmol/L, Cao et al., 2009). The higher levels of genistein aglycone observed in many endocrine-responsive rat tissues relative to the blood suggest that accumulation is typical and that similar tissue levels could occur in human populations. Placental transfer of genistein in rats was also examined as a possible route of developmental exposure (Doerge et al., 2001). Pregnant Sprague\u2013Dawley rats were administered genistein orally, either by diet or by gavage at doses of approximately 50 mg/kg bw/d. Concentrations of genistein aglycone and conjugates were measured in maternal and offspring serum and brain using HPLC with isotope dilution electrospray tandem mass spectrometry (LC/MS/MS). Al- though fetal or neonatal serum concentrations of total genistein were approximately 20-fold lower than maternal serum concentrations, the biologically active genistein aglycone concentration was only 5-fold lower. Fetal brain contained predominately genistein aglycone at levels similar to those in the maternal brain. These results showed that genistein aglycone crosses the rat placenta and can reach fetal brain from maternal serum genistein levels that are relevant to those observed in humans consuming soy foods and dietary supplements. Another study measured the internal exposures of postnatal day 10 (PND10) rat pups due to lactational transfer of genistein (Doerge et al., 2006). Conjugated and aglycone forms of genistein were measured by using LC/MS/MS in serum (PND10) and milk (PND7) from lactating dams consuming a genistein-fortified soy-free diet that delivered a dose of approximately 50 mg/kg bw/d and in serum from their pups at a time when milk was the only food source (PND10). This study showed that limited lactational transfer of genistein to rat pups occurs and that internal exposures to the active aglycone formof genistein are generally lower than those measured previously in the fetal period. These results suggested that developmental effects attributable to genistein exposure in the previously published chronic and multigeneration studies are more likely to result from fetal exposures because of the higher levels of the active estrogenic aglycone form of genistein in utero, although the possibility of neonatal responses cannot be excluded. A recent study determined the bioavailability of genistein and daidzein in Balb/c mice by comparing plasma pharmacokinetics of aglycone and conjugated forms following administration of identical doses (1.2 mg/kg genistein and 0.55 mg/kg daidzein) by either an intravenous injection or gavage of the aglycones vs. a bolus administration of equimolar doses delivered in a food pellet prepared using commercial SPI as the isoflavone source (Andrade et al., 2010). The bioavailability of genistein and daidzein was equivalent for the gavage and dietary routes of administration despite the use of isoflavone aglycones in the former and SPI-derived glucosides in the latter. While absorption of total isoflavones was nearly quantitative from both oral routes, presystemic and systemic Phase II conjugation greatly attenuated internal exposures to the receptor-active aglycone isoflavones. These results show that SPI, a major form of soy used in the manufacture of food and infant formula, is an efficient isoflavone delivery vehicle capable of providing significant proportions of the total dose into the circulation in the active aglycone form for distribution to receptor-bearing tissues and subsequent pharmaco- logical effects that determine possible health benefits and/or risks. Thesepublished toxicology and exposure assessments of rats treated with dietary genistein demonstrate clearly adverse effects from chronic (e.g., increased incidences of mammary adenoma/carcinoma in females) and developmental exposures (e.g., accelerated reproductive senescence in females and increased incidences ofmammary adenoma/ carcinoma in females). In addition, plasmameasurements in the dietary genistein-treated group rats show that these doses produce circulating levels, and presumably tissue levels, that are similar to identifiable humans groups. Of particular note are babies consuming their entire nutritional input from soy infant formula. The circulating levels in these infants overlap the range of serum concentrations measured in rats consuming the high dose of genistein, for which the aforementioned adverse effects were observed. The very low margin of exposure between doses of genistein that produce demonstrably adverse effects in experimental animal models and those in 20\u201325% of all formula-fed children in the United States suggests that the possibility of adverse effects should be considered.

Based on the delineated biotransformation pathways, 2,3,3,3-tetrafluoroepoxypropane 2 is expected to be the only reactive intermediate conceivable as presented in Scheme 1. At higher rates of formation, some of this reactive intermediate may escape detoxication by glutathione conjugation and result in covalent binding thus initiating cytotoxicity. Oxidation of HFO-1234yf may be presumed to be mainly occurring in liver due to the presence of higher activity of CYP 2E1 in this organ. Therefore, liver toxicity should be expected, but wasnot observed. An involvementof the cysteineS-conjugate\u03b2-lyase in toxicity could explain themild kidney effects, However, this pathway is also considered unlikely to be involved in the observed kidney effects, since cysteine S-conjugate 6 cannot be cleaved to a toxic thioketene or thionoacyl fluoride due to the absence of a halogene atom at the carbon next to the sulphur (Dekant et al., 1988; Vamvakas et al., 1989; Anders andDekant, 1998). Probably, an alternative processingofHFO-1234yf in pregnant rabbits yields a stable but toxic metabolite, which is not formed in non-pregnant animals.

Tan et al. / Toxicology and Applied Pharmacology 269 (2013) 163\u2013168 A-treatment groups were significantly greater than that of the con- trol. No differences were observed in plasma progesterone concentra- tion (data not shown). Effect of bisphenol A on placental aromatase(cyp19) and crh mRNA expression in mice Since bisphenol A could increase CRH and estrogen in the blood, we looked into crh and cyp19mRNA expression in the placental tissue. Mice treated with 200 mg/kg bisphenol A displayed an elevated crh mRNA expression (Fig. 2). However, this induction was not seen in cyp19 (data not shown). Increased plasma testosterone concentration in bisphenol A-treated mice Since estrogen biosynthesis could be affected by substrate avail- ability, the plasma testosterone concentration was measured. Our re- sult indicated that plasma testosterone concentration was increased by 20 and 200 mg/kg bisphenol A treatment (Fig. 3). The increased testosterone concentration could lead to the escalation in plasma estrogen. Immunoblot on nuclear CREB isolated from the placental tissue As mentioned in the Introduction, crh has CRE in its promoter re- gion. The status of CRE binding protein (CREB) could be a major play- er in the regulation. In fact, CREB protein levels were increased after bisphenol A treatment (Fig. 4A). The optical density data also illus- trated the dose-dependent increase (Fig. 4B). PKC isoforms were differentially activated in the placenta The phosphorylated forms of PKCs were quantified by immunoblot- ting, and protein kinase C \u03b6/\u03bb and \u03b4 were increased (Fig. 5A). Optical density analysis indicated that placental PKC \u03b6/\u03bb was significantly in- creased in all bisphenol A treatment groups (Fig. 5B) while a significant increase of placental PKC \u03b4 was only seen in mice treated with 200 mg bisphenol A/kg (Fig. 5C). Effect of bisphenol A on early delivery Bisphenol A induced premature birth in mice. Chi-Square test re- sult indicated an increased incidence (P b 0.05) of preterm delivery in the pooled bisphenol A treatment groups when compared to the control (0 mg/kg bisphenol A) group. Subsequent analysis by using Chi-Square test for trend illustrated that an increasing trend of preterm delivery was correlated (P b 0.05) with increased bisphenol A dos- ages (Fig. 6). Discussion In thepresent study,wedemonstrated increasedplasmaestrogen and CRH concentrations in mice exposed to high doses of bisphenol A. Fur- thermore, the phosphorylated forms of PKC \u03b6/\u03bb and \u03b4 in placentae were increased after bisphenol A treatment. Because ERE and CRE are found in the promoter region of crh, the increased placental phospho-PKC and plasma estrogen could be the potential activation mechanisms. The promoter of crh contains two half sites of estrogen response el- ements (ERE) and one cAMP response element (CRE) binding regions (Yao and Denver, 2007). The role of estrogen in crh transactivation is obscure. Vamvakopoulos and Chrousos (1993) have demonstrated the stimulatory effect of estrogen on CRH transcription in vitro. However, other investigators failed to show the same. Ni et al. (2004) have over-expressed ER isoforms in placental cells and observed no increase on gene transactivation. Estrogen may even suppress the transactivity of CRH promoter by interfering with CRE binding (Ni et al., 2002). In the present study, the increased concentration of estrogen did not ap- pear to repress the mRNA expression of placental crh. CRE binding is crucial in the transcriptional control of CRH. The phosphorylation of CREB, which could be a downstream response of PKC activation, would bind to the target sequence to initiate CRH transactivation (Cheng and Handwerger, 2005). The distribution of dif- ferent PKC isoforms in placental syncytiotrophoblast has been reported previously (Ruzycky et al., 1996). PKC \u03b2I and II, \u03b5 and \u03b6 are localized in the microvillus, whereas \u03b2II, \u03b5, \u03b6 and \u03b1-isoforms can be found on the basal membranes. These PKC isoforms appear to receive or respond to differential signals. Although the importance of PKC in placental func- tioning has not been fully established, many downstream gene expres- sions of PKC have been identified in placental tissue. Yue et al. (2008) have demonstrated that the PKC activator phorbol ester stimulates pla- cental corticotrophin-releasing hormone gene (CRH) transactivation through a CRE binding mechanism. Others have also reported that genes encoded for human gonadotropin-releasing hormone receptor (Cheng et al., 2000) and relaxin (Peters et al., 2000) are also regulated by PKC. In the present study, it appears that activation of the novel and atypical PKCs as mentioned above could be associated with in- creased crh expression. Mice exposed to bisphenol A since prenatal stage display increased incidence of blood-filled ovarian bursae and reduced percentage of cor- pora lutea (Markey et al., 2003). Others have reported that bisphenol A exposure increases aneuploidy in oocytes or meiotic disturbances in mice (Hunt et al., 2003). Aneuploidy of the ovumhas been linked tomis- carriages, and a similar correlation has also been reported in humans (Sugiura-Ogasawara et al., 2005). Bisphenol A exposure during gesta- tion and lactation periods suppresses the activities of macrophages iso- lated from the mother mice and their infants (Pyo et al., 2007). The compound also reduces the number of embryos, uterine weight, and the intervillous spaces of the placenta in pregnant mice. Ultimately, the survival rate of the mouse neonates is decreased (Tachibana et al., 2007). An influence on embryonic development has also been docu- mented (Takai et al., 2000). In pregnant rats,messenger RNA expression of placental prolactin-growth hormone and its stimulating genes Pit-1a/ b are repressed upon bisphenol A exposure (Lee et al., 2005). Placental prolactin and growth hormone are important in fetal metabolism and growth (Freemark, 2010). In the present study, bisphenol A was shown to increase CRH in mice and early delivery ultimately. These studies demonstrate that bisphenol A could be a multi-targeted endo- crine disruptor. 168 W. Tan et al. / Toxicology and Applied Pharmacology 269 (2013) 163\u2013168 In summary, bisphenol A increased plasma concentrations of CRH, testosterone, and estrogen. It also activated placental PKC isoforms \u03b6/\u03bb and \u03b4, which could be the signaling pathway for premature birth.

Tan et al. / Toxicology and Applied Pharmacology 269 (2013) 163\u2013168 A-treatment groups were significantly greater than that of the con- trol. No differences were observed in plasma progesterone concentra- tion (data not shown). Effect of bisphenol A on placental aromatase(cyp19) and crh mRNA expression in mice Since bisphenol A could increase CRH and estrogen in the blood, we looked into crh and cyp19mRNA expression in the placental tissue. Mice treated with 200 mg/kg bisphenol A displayed an elevated crh mRNA expression (Fig. 2). However, this induction was not seen in cyp19 (data not shown). Increased plasma testosterone concentration in bisphenol A-treated mice Since estrogen biosynthesis could be affected by substrate avail- ability, the plasma testosterone concentration was measured. Our re- sult indicated that plasma testosterone concentration was increased by 20 and 200 mg/kg bisphenol A treatment (Fig. 3). The increased testosterone concentration could lead to the escalation in plasma estrogen. Immunoblot on nuclear CREB isolated from the placental tissue As mentioned in the Introduction, crh has CRE in its promoter re- gion. The status of CRE binding protein (CREB) could be a major play- er in the regulation. In fact, CREB protein levels were increased after bisphenol A treatment (Fig. 4A). The optical density data also illus- trated the dose-dependent increase (Fig. 4B). PKC isoforms were differentially activated in the placenta The phosphorylated forms of PKCs were quantified by immunoblot- ting, and protein kinase C \u03b6/\u03bb and \u03b4 were increased (Fig. 5A). Optical density analysis indicated that placental PKC \u03b6/\u03bb was significantly in- creased in all bisphenol A treatment groups (Fig. 5B) while a significant increase of placental PKC \u03b4 was only seen in mice treated with 200 mg bisphenol A/kg (Fig. 5C). Effect of bisphenol A on early delivery Bisphenol A induced premature birth in mice. Chi-Square test re- sult indicated an increased incidence (P b 0.05) of preterm delivery in the pooled bisphenol A treatment groups when compared to the control (0 mg/kg bisphenol A) group. Subsequent analysis by using Chi-Square test for trend illustrated that an increasing trend of preterm delivery was correlated (P b 0.05) with increased bisphenol A dos- ages (Fig. 6). Discussion In thepresent study,wedemonstrated increasedplasmaestrogen and CRH concentrations in mice exposed to high doses of bisphenol A. Fur- thermore, the phosphorylated forms of PKC \u03b6/\u03bb and \u03b4 in placentae were increased after bisphenol A treatment. Because ERE and CRE are found in the promoter region of crh, the increased placental phospho-PKC and plasma estrogen could be the potential activation mechanisms. The promoter of crh contains two half sites of estrogen response el- ements (ERE) and one cAMP response element (CRE) binding regions (Yao and Denver, 2007). The role of estrogen in crh transactivation is obscure. Vamvakopoulos and Chrousos (1993) have demonstrated the stimulatory effect of estrogen on CRH transcription in vitro. However, other investigators failed to show the same. Ni et al. (2004) have over-expressed ER isoforms in placental cells and observed no increase on gene transactivation. Estrogen may even suppress the transactivity of CRH promoter by interfering with CRE binding (Ni et al., 2002). In the present study, the increased concentration of estrogen did not ap- pear to repress the mRNA expression of placental crh. CRE binding is crucial in the transcriptional control of CRH. The phosphorylation of CREB, which could be a downstream response of PKC activation, would bind to the target sequence to initiate CRH transactivation (Cheng and Handwerger, 2005). The distribution of dif- ferent PKC isoforms in placental syncytiotrophoblast has been reported previously (Ruzycky et al., 1996). PKC \u03b2I and II, \u03b5 and \u03b6 are localized in the microvillus, whereas \u03b2II, \u03b5, \u03b6 and \u03b1-isoforms can be found on the basal membranes. These PKC isoforms appear to receive or respond to differential signals. Although the importance of PKC in placental func- tioning has not been fully established, many downstream gene expres- sions of PKC have been identified in placental tissue. Yue et al. (2008) have demonstrated that the PKC activator phorbol ester stimulates pla- cental corticotrophin-releasing hormone gene (CRH) transactivation through a CRE binding mechanism. Others have also reported that genes encoded for human gonadotropin-releasing hormone receptor (Cheng et al., 2000) and relaxin (Peters et al., 2000) are also regulated by PKC. In the present study, it appears that activation of the novel and atypical PKCs as mentioned above could be associated with in- creased crh expression. Mice exposed to bisphenol A since prenatal stage display increased incidence of blood-filled ovarian bursae and reduced percentage of cor- pora lutea (Markey et al., 2003). Others have reported that bisphenol A exposure increases aneuploidy in oocytes or meiotic disturbances in mice (Hunt et al., 2003). Aneuploidy of the ovumhas been linked tomis- carriages, and a similar correlation has also been reported in humans (Sugiura-Ogasawara et al., 2005). Bisphenol A exposure during gesta- tion and lactation periods suppresses the activities of macrophages iso- lated from the mother mice and their infants (Pyo et al., 2007). The compound also reduces the number of embryos, uterine weight, and the intervillous spaces of the placenta in pregnant mice. Ultimately, the survival rate of the mouse neonates is decreased (Tachibana et al., 2007). An influence on embryonic development has also been docu- mented (Takai et al., 2000). In pregnant rats,messenger RNA expression of placental prolactin-growth hormone and its stimulating genes Pit-1a/ b are repressed upon bisphenol A exposure (Lee et al., 2005). Placental prolactin and growth hormone are important in fetal metabolism and growth (Freemark, 2010). In the present study, bisphenol A was shown to increase CRH in mice and early delivery ultimately. These studies demonstrate that bisphenol A could be a multi-targeted endo- crine disruptor. 168 W. Tan et al. / Toxicology and Applied Pharmacology 269 (2013) 163\u2013168 In summary, bisphenol A increased plasma concentrations of CRH, testosterone, and estrogen. It also activated placental PKC isoforms \u03b6/\u03bb and \u03b4, which could be the signaling pathway for premature birth.

The presence of BPA in consumer products is a great con- cern due to the numerous studies investigating the potentially adverse effects of BPA exposure. However, a recent study has indicated that BPA exposure in adults can be decreased with certain lifestyle choices. Urinary BPA concentrations were significantly lowered in participants when they ate fresh foods compared towhen they ate canned and pack- aged foods or food from a restaurant (Rudel et al., 2011). Therefore, though further studies should be conducted, our data indicate that it may be possible to decrease exposure to BPA and recover from any adverse hormonal effects, potentially limiting adverse health effects associated with BPA.

Between adult marmosets and young adult rats, there is at least a 100-fold difference in the sensitivity towards testes toxicity induced by orally administered DEHP (no effects in marmosets dosed by gavage with 2500 mg/kg per day, Kurata et al., 1998, Tomonari et al., 2003; NOEL in rats receiving 3.7 mg/ kg per day via food, Poon et al., 1997). Probably, toxico- kinetics alone cannot account for the observed differences in toxicity, suggesting that toxicodynamic factors (possibly interactions of MEHP with receptor-mediated processes) may also contribute to this pronounced difference between the rodent and the primate species.

Chen et al. / Toxicology and Applied Pharmacology 329 (2017) 58\u201366 after exposure to a red tide bloom (Walsh et al., 2015; Walsh et al., 2007). Rescued loggerhead turtles exhibited an up to two-fold increase in SOD, when compared to healthy captive turtles, which correlated to plasma brevetoxin levels (Walsh et al., 2010). Brevetoxin exposure in coral larvae induced an increase in lipid hydroperoxide content and cat- alase activity in coral larvae (Ross et al., 2010) and induced lipid perox- idation in fish gills (Woo et al., 2006). PbTx-2 induced apoptosis in human Jurkat cells (Walsh et al., 2008). Furthermore, the brevetoxins have been shown using the comet assay, to induce DNA damage in rat liver (Leighfield et al., 2009) human lymphocytes (Sayer et al., 2005) and Jurkat cells (Murrell & Gibson, 2009). A mechanism for brevetoxin induced oxidative stress has not been identified. We propose that the mechanism is the alkylation of Sec 422 of TrxR.

The main findings of our study include the discovery that hyperglycemia in diabetes causes phosphoryla- tion of CDK9. CDK9 phosphorylation subsequently leads to alteration of the MAPK signaling axis, resulting in the transcription of inflammatory cyto- kines. These alterations manifest as renal functional deficiency. Inhibition of CDK9 in diabetic mice and renal cells exposed to high levels of glucose, largely prevents MAPK activation and elaboration of in- flammatory cytokines. 4 Discussion 5 Conclusion Author contributions Declaration of Competing Interest Acknowledgements Appendix A Supplementary data References"}},

Nowadays, despite that the therapeutic approaches of targeted therapy continue to evolve and have made great progresses in clinical practice, chemotherapy is still an indispensable strategy for cancer ther- apy (DeVita and Chu, 2008). However, patients administered for long periods of time with chemotherapeutic agents always display different toxicity profiles, and little is known about the most frequent and treat- able side effects, such as delayed diarrhea ((Wadler et al., 1998; Pro et al., 2001). If this symptom failed to be recognized and adequately treated, it will be life-threatening. For these reasons, early assessment and prevention of chemotherapy-induced colitis are essential to im- prove life qualities and ongoing treatment administration (Saltz et al., 2000; Lenfers et al., 1999). According to recent researches, many anti- cancer chemotherapeutic agents display the capacity to modulate im- mune responses, including inducing immunogenic cell activation or death, to cause cytotoxic events (Lake and Robinson, 2005; Nakasone et al., 2012; Zhu et al., 2007). CPT-11, having great efficacy on anticancer therapy and being used as the first line treatment for colorectal cancer, showed severe side ef- fects, especially colitis (Rothenberg et al., 1996). A previous clinical study has discovered that CPT-11 could induce mucosal injury due to dysfunction of leukocytes (Shinohara et al., 1998). However, the mech- anism of CPT-11 induced delayed diarrhea is not quite understood. In our study, we found that CPT-11 induced experimental colitis, including loss of basal body weight, diarrhea and reduced colon length by modu- lating the immune system. We first identified the sensitized effect of CPT-11 on macrophages and the possible mechanisms may due to NLRP3 inflammasome activation. IL-1\u03b2, mainly produced by activated macrophages, is an essential proinflammatory cytokine for the early phase of the colonic inflamma- tion cascade and tightly correlated with the severity of colon damage (Mahida et al., 1989). It is now well established that bioactive IL-1\u03b2 is produced by NLRP3 inflammasome-activated caspase-1 from an inac- tive 31-kDa precursor to an activated 17-kDa precursor. Researchers have already proved that DSS-induced experimental colitis is due to NLRP3/caspase-1-mediated maturation of IL-1\u03b2 (Coccia et al., 2012). IL-18, produced along with IL-1\u03b2, was also converted by activated caspase-1 to their functional cytokine and contributed to intestinal in- flammation. Blocking IL-18 was effective for preventing the progress of experimental models of colitis (Zaki et al., 2010), and it is also con- firmed that some compounds can prevent the colitis by hampering NLRP3 inflammasome activation (Siegmund, 2010). Our in vivo and vitro experiments here showed that CPT-11 significantly elevated the expression of IL-1\u03b2/IL-18 and activated caspase-1. We discovered that CPT-11 induced delayed diarrhea at least partially due to its activation of NLRP3 inflammasome. Increased proinflammatory cytokine production is a hallmark of in- flammatory disease (Bauer et al., 2010). In this study, CPT-11 successful- ly induced colitis by elevating the levels of IL-1\u03b2, IL-18, TNF-\u03b1, IL-6 and IL-17A in colons. Moreover, we showed that CPT-11 triggered the acti- vation of macrophages by activating NF-\u03baB, STAT1 and MAPK signaling pathways. It is well established that the activation of NLRP3 inflammasome is a two-hit model requiring both TLR (Toll like recep- tor) and inflammasome assembly (Feng et al., 2014). Transcriptions of proIL-1\u03b2 and proIL-18 depend on TLR triggering. NF-\u03baB andMAPK fam- ilies were the most common downstream signaling molecules of TLR. NF-\u03baB and JNKwere themost important downstream transcription fac- tors responsible for proIL-1\u03b2 and proIL-18 transcriptions.While another hit is needed for the release of IL-1\u03b2 and IL-18, the inflammasome as- sembly is K+ efflux-dependent, lysosomal-dependent and reactive oxy- gen species (ROS)-dependent (Schroder and Tschopp, 2010). Indeed, CPT-11 has an important role in the two-step activation. THP-1 cells treated with CPT-11 showed significantly activation of NF-\u03baB and JNK at a dose of 10 \u03bcM. Additionally, the mRNA levels of IL-1\u03b2 and IL-18 were also elevated by CPT-11 at 5 \u03bcM and 10 \u03bcM. ROS levels were ele- vated by LPS plus CPT-11 treatment which was comparable to LPS/ ATP treatment. Blocking NF-\u03baB and JNK activation by their specific in- hibitors significantly inhibited IL-1\u03b2 and IL-18 secretion. Recent re- searches reported that the MAPK family has dual roles in NLRP3 inflammasome activation: P38, JNK and ERK activationwas all responsi- ble for proIL-1\u03b2 and proIL-18 transcriptions. While P38 activation has little effect on the second signal of NLRP3 inflammasome activation, JNK activation could trigger mitochondrial ROS production and ERK ac- tivation could affect protease stability to trigger inflammasome assem- bly. According to our findings, CPT-11 could specifically activated JNK and has little effect on P38 and ERK activation. Combined with ROS 141Q. Li et al. / Toxicology and Applied Pharmacology 289 (2015) 133\u2013141 levels, these data represented that CPT-11 could activate NLRP3 inflammasome through both hits. In conclusion, our work discovered a novel mechanism for CPT-11 induced colitis by activating NLRP3 inflammasome. These results indi- cate that inhibition of NLRP3 inflammasome might be an attractive strategy in clinical treatment with CPT-11 induced delayed diarrhea, and these drugs which have potentials in inhibiting NF-\u03baB and JNK phosphorylation can be used in this condition. In conclusion, our work provides a new insight into CPT-11 induced delayed diarrhea. Conflict of interest The authors declare that they have no conflicts of interest concerning this article.

Discussions Conflict of interest Transparency document Acknowledgment References", "Acknowledgement": "The use of chemotherapy in cancer treatment began at the early 20th century. Nowadays, despite that the therapeutic approaches of targeted therapy continue to evolve and have made great progresses in clinical practice, chemotherapy is still an indispensable strategy for cancer ther- apy (DeVita and Chu, 2008). However, patients administered for long periods of time with chemotherapeutic agents always display different toxicity profiles, and little is known about the most frequent and treat- able side effects, such as delayed diarrhea ((Wadler et al., 1998; Pro et al., 2001). If this symptom failed to be recognized and adequately treated, it will be life-threatening. For these reasons, early assessment and prevention of chemotherapy-induced colitis are essential to im- prove life qualities and ongoing treatment administration (Saltz et al., 2000; Lenfers et al., 1999). According to recent researches, many anti- cancer chemotherapeutic agents display the capacity to modulate im- mune responses, including inducing immunogenic cell activation or death, to cause cytotoxic events (Lake and Robinson, 2005; Nakasone et al., 2012; Zhu et al., 2007). CPT-11, having great efficacy on anticancer therapy and being used as the first line treatment for colorectal cancer, showed severe side ef- fects, especially colitis (Rothenberg et al., 1996). A previous clinical study has discovered that CPT-11 could induce mucosal injury due to dysfunction of leukocytes (Shinohara et al., 1998). However, the mech- anism of CPT-11 induced delayed diarrhea is not quite understood. In our study, we found that CPT-11 induced experimental colitis, including loss of basal body weight, diarrhea and reduced colon length by modu- lating the immune system. We first identified the sensitized effect of CPT-11 on macrophages and the possible mechanisms may due to NLRP3 inflammasome activation. IL-1\u03b2, mainly produced by activated macrophages, is an essential proinflammatory cytokine for the early phase of the colonic inflamma- tion cascade and tightly correlated with the severity of colon damage (Mahida et al., 1989). It is now well established that bioactive IL-1\u03b2 is produced by NLRP3 inflammasome-activated caspase-1 from an inac- tive 31-kDa precursor to an activated 17-kDa precursor. Researchers have already proved that DSS-induced experimental colitis is due to NLRP3/caspase-1-mediated maturation of IL-1\u03b2 (Coccia et al., 2012). IL-18, produced along with IL-1\u03b2, was also converted by activated caspase-1 to their functional cytokine and contributed to intestinal in- flammation. Blocking IL-18 was effective for preventing the progress of experimental models of colitis (Zaki et al., 2010), and it is also con- firmed that some compounds can prevent the colitis by hampering NLRP3 inflammasome activation (Siegmund, 2010). Our in vivo and vitro experiments here showed that CPT-11 significantly elevated the expression of IL-1\u03b2/IL-18 and activated caspase-1. We discovered that CPT-11 induced delayed diarrhea at least partially due to its activation of NLRP3 inflammasome. Increased proinflammatory cytokine production is a hallmark of in- flammatory disease (Bauer et al., 2010). In this study, CPT-11 successful- ly induced colitis by elevating the levels of IL-1\u03b2, IL-18, TNF-\u03b1, IL-6 and IL-17A in colons. Moreover, we showed that CPT-11 triggered the acti- vation of macrophages by activating NF-\u03baB, STAT1 and MAPK signaling pathways. It is well established that the activation of NLRP3 inflammasome is a two-hit model requiring both TLR (Toll like recep- tor) and inflammasome assembly (Feng et al., 2014). Transcriptions of proIL-1\u03b2 and proIL-18 depend on TLR triggering. NF-\u03baB andMAPK fam- ilies were the most common downstream signaling molecules of TLR. NF-\u03baB and JNKwere themost important downstream transcription fac- tors responsible for proIL-1\u03b2 and proIL-18 transcriptions.While another hit is needed for the release of IL-1\u03b2 and IL-18, the inflammasome as- sembly is K+ efflux-dependent, lysosomal-dependent and reactive oxy- gen species (ROS)-dependent (Schroder and Tschopp, 2010). Indeed, CPT-11 has an important role in the two-step activation. THP-1 cells treated with CPT-11 showed significantly activation of NF-\u03baB and JNK at a dose of 10 \u03bcM. Additionally, the mRNA levels of IL-1\u03b2 and IL-18 were also elevated by CPT-11 at 5 \u03bcM and 10 \u03bcM. ROS levels were ele- vated by LPS plus CPT-11 treatment which was comparable to LPS/ ATP treatment. Blocking NF-\u03baB and JNK activation by their specific in- hibitors significantly inhibited IL-1\u03b2 and IL-18 secretion. Recent re- searches reported that the MAPK family has dual roles in NLRP3 inflammasome activation: P38, JNK and ERK activationwas all responsi- ble for proIL-1\u03b2 and proIL-18 transcriptions. While P38 activation has little effect on the second signal of NLRP3 inflammasome activation, JNK activation could trigger mitochondrial ROS production and ERK ac- tivation could affect protease stability to trigger inflammasome assem- bly. According to our findings, CPT-11 could specifically activated JNK and has little effect on P38 and ERK activation. Combined with ROS 141Q. Li et al. / Toxicology and Applied Pharmacology 289 (2015) 133\u2013141 levels, these data represented that CPT-11 could activate NLRP3 inflammasome through both hits. In conclusion, our work discovered a novel mechanism for CPT-11 induced colitis by activating NLRP3 inflammasome. These results indi- cate that inhibition of NLRP3 inflammasome might be an attractive strategy in clinical treatment with CPT-11 induced delayed diarrhea, and these drugs which have potentials in inhibiting NF-\u03baB and JNK phosphorylation can be used in this condition. In conclusion, our work provides a new insight into CPT-11 induced delayed diarrhea. Conflict of interest The authors declare that they have no conflicts of interest concerning this article.

This targeted metabolomic analysis identified a novel correlation between an INH metabolite and INH-induced toxicity, and provides an opportunity to establish a biomarker that can be used to monitor INH induced toxicity activity through noninvasive measurements. Accordingly, metabolomics, can be used as a tool for measuring small-molecule metabolite profiles and fluxes in biological matrices, and thus monitor endogenous and exogenous variation of drug metabolism in animal models and in humans.

For CYP3A substrates, the barrier activity of the small intestine may be facilitated by the multidrug efflux pump p-glycoprotein, which is expressed in the intestine and functions in concert with CYP3A (Lindell et al., 2003; Wacher et al., 1998). Our results suggest that xenobiotics that are substrates for CYP3A may have poor bioavailability in horse. However, the role of the intestinal mucosa as a site of first-pass metabolism by CYP3A-enzymes has not been examined in horse. Thus, further studies are needed to explore the metabolic and pharmacokinetic consequences of CYP3A in the horse intestines.

L-Buthionine sulfoximine-induced GSH depletion potentiated cytotoxicity and apoptosis induced by dauricine, while CYP3A inhibitor ketoconazole reversed dauricine-induced GSH depletion and apoptosis. It is most likely that quinone methide intermediate 2 was responsible for dauricine-induced cellular GSH depletion. The depletion of GSH may trigger and/or intensify the cytotoxicity and apoptosis of dauricine. Conflict of interest statement The authors declare that there are no conflicts of interest.

The precise mechanism by which CBD causes oxidative stress and the associated caspase- 8 activation in primary lymphocytes is currently under investigation.

BkF cardiotoxicity is AHR2- and CYP1A-independent across a range of doses. Uninjected embryos and embryos injectedwith the indicatedmorpholinos were exposed to BkF at 4\u201340 \u03bcM to 48 hpf, and then pericardial edemawas quantified as increased pericardial area in lateral images. Data represent a single experiment with 14 or 15 embryos per treatment group (mean \u00b1 s.e.m.). Asterisks indicate treatment groups significantly different from uninjected controls as described in the text (ANOVA with Tukey\u2013Kramer HSD (\u03b1 = 0.05). 248 J.P. Incardona et al. / Toxicology and Applied Pharmacology 257 (2011) 242\u2013249 myocardial AHR activation (indicated by CYP1A induction), which is sim- ply blocked by AHR2 knockdown, restoring normal cardiacmorphogene- sis (Incardona et al., 2006; Scott et al., 2011). By contrast, it is difficult to reconcile the pattern of CYP1A induction resulting fromBkF exposure, the effects of AHR2 knockdown on that pattern, and the impacts of BkF expo- sure on heart function. Consistent with predictions based on AHR agonist activity in cell lines (Barron et al., 2004), BkF is a strong inducer in zebra- fish, causing qualitativelymuch higher levels of AHR2-dependent epider- mal CYP1A immunofluorescence than BaP. If BkF acts directly on the myocardium to reduce heart rate and cause atrial dilation, it does sowith- out evidence of AHR activation in target cardiac cells. It is possible that BkF acts on myocardial cells through one of the other zebrafish AHR orthologs (AHR1A and AHR1B), independent of CYP1A induction. This is highly unlikely, as cyp1a is consistently the most highly induced gene following AHR activation (Alexeyenko et al., 2010; Carney et al., 2006). There is no simple mechanism to explain how BkF could induce CYP1A in an AHR2-dependent manner in epidermal cells, but fail to induce CYP1A in myocardial cells. An alternative explanation is that cardiac toxicity in BkF-exposed embryos is a result of a metabolite of BkF, or another metabolic alter- ation resulting from BkF exposure. BkF toxicity was moderately increased by CYP1A knockdown, which could indicate either that the parent compound causes toxicity, or that more parent compound is accessible to another metabolic pathway. The interaction between BkF and the standard control morpholino is unusual and also could impli- cate a metabolic mechanism. The standard control morpholino targets a splice site in the human \u00df-globin gene, has no antisense activity in zebrafish cells, and was selected for its absence of off-target biological activity or toxicity (Lacerra et al., 2000) (http://www.gene-tools.com/ node/23#standardcontrols). Some morpholinos have been shown to produce off-target toxicity causing apoptotic cell death through the p53 pathway (Robu et al., 2007). We have used the standard control morpholino with several other PAHs, and have not observed a similarly increased sensitivity to PAH toxicity (Incardona et al., 2006). There are no similar published findings that may suggest a plausible hypothesis underlying this effect. A BLAST search against the current zebrafish genome database with this sequence reveals only two anonymous sequences that have a partial (19 base pair) overlapwith themorpholino target sequence. Therefore, the control morpholino cannot be targeting a known member of the AHR or cytochrome P450 family. The observed synergism cannot be due to a generalmetabolic property ofmorpholinos, because the effectwas sequence-specific, i.e. did not occurwith either the ahr2-specific negative control morpholino, or the ahr2 antisense morpholino. The PAH compositions derived from non-point sources such as stormwater runoff are complex and typically reflect a mixture of com- bustive and petrogenic sources (Hwang and Foster, 2006; Stein et al., 2006). Comparison of dissolved-phase and particulate-associated PAHs usually shows a predominance of 2- and 3-ring compounds in the dis- solved phase, with a predominance of 4-, 5-, and 6-ring compounds in the particulate fraction. While the bulk of larger particle-associated PAHs may not be bioavailable to organisms such as fish embryos that are primarily impacted bydissolved PAHs (Carls et al., 2008), a key ques- tion is how lower concentrations of compounds such as BaP and BkF might modify the toxicity of a mixture that is otherwise predominantly petrogenic. Because CYP1A induction is primarily protective against pet- rogenic PAH toxicity (Hicken et al., 2011; Incardona et al., 2005), the presence of low concentrations of potent CYP1A inducers could poten- tially reduce the effects of 3-ring compounds in amixture. Alternatively, if CYP1A metabolic capacity was already overwhelmed by higher con- centrations of low molecular weight PAHs (which occurs at about 10 \u03bcg/L in zebrafish; (Hicken et al., 2011), the high molecular weight compounds may produce additive or greater-than-additive (i.e., syner- gistic) impacts on cardiac function and morphogenesis. The finding that the various mixtures of BeP, BaP, and BkF did not produce interme- diate levels of toxicity suggests that there may be more complicated in- teractions between these compounds, which should be examined in more detailed studies. In conclusion, these findings refine and extend our understanding of how individual PAHs cause developmental toxicity via a diversity of tox- icokinetic and toxicodynamic processes. This understanding is critical for assessing the combinatorial toxicity of PAHmixtures in aquatic hab- itats, both within and between petrogenic and pyrogenic sources. There are numerous implications for improving environmental assessment in PAH-contaminated environments. This includes, for example, future as- sessments of oil spill impacts (primarily petrogenic PAH mixtures) in riverine, estuarine, or coastal marine habitats where inputs from urban stormwater runoff (primarily pyrogenic mixtures) are common. A long-term goal of this work is to develop mechanism-based markers of the biological effects of complex PAHmixtures in sensitive early life his- tory stages of fish. This goal is dependent on a detailed understanding of the various pathways through which PAH toxicity converges on the de- veloping fish heart. Although the results of our zebrafish screening approach with high concentrations of single compounds may not be environmentally relevant, they shed light on pathways (e.g. AHR- dependent and novel AHR-independent) for which gene expression markers can be developed and tested with real-world mixtures. These types of mechanistic analyses using the zebrafish model will ultimately inform the development of a new generation of biomarkers that will be diagnostic of different types of PAH exposures in fish spawning habitats and, at the same time, phenotypically anchored to cardiac performance, heart and vascular development, and fish survival.

By contrast, it is difficult to reconcile the pattern of CYP1A induction resulting fromBkF exposure, the effects of AHR2 knockdown on that pattern, and the impacts of BkF expo- sure on heart function. Consistent with predictions based on AHR agonist activity in cell lines (Barron et al., 2004), BkF is a strong inducer in zebra- fish, causing qualitativelymuch higher levels of AHR2-dependent epider- mal CYP1A immunofluorescence than BaP. If BkF acts directly on the myocardium to reduce heart rate and cause atrial dilation, it does sowith- out evidence of AHR activation in target cardiac cells. It is possible that BkF acts on myocardial cells through one of the other zebrafish AHR orthologs (AHR1A and AHR1B), independent of CYP1A induction. This is highly unlikely, as cyp1a is consistently the most highly induced gene following AHR activation (Alexeyenko et al., 2010; Carney et al., 2006). There is no simple mechanism to explain how BkF could induce CYP1A in an AHR2-dependent manner in epidermal cells, but fail to induce CYP1A in myocardial cells. An alternative explanation is that cardiac toxicity in BkF-exposed embryos is a result of a metabolite of BkF, or another metabolic alter- ation resulting from BkF exposure. BkF toxicity was moderately increased by CYP1A knockdown, which could indicate either that the parent compound causes toxicity, or that more parent compound is accessible to another metabolic pathway. The interaction between BkF and the standard control morpholino is unusual and also could impli- cate a metabolic mechanism. The standard control morpholino targets a splice site in the human \u00df-globin gene, has no antisense activity in zebrafish cells, and was selected for its absence of off-target biological activity or toxicity (Lacerra et al., 2000) (http://www.gene-tools.com/ node/23#standardcontrols). Some morpholinos have been shown to produce off-target toxicity causing apoptotic cell death through the p53 pathway (Robu et al., 2007). We have used the standard control morpholino with several other PAHs, and have not observed a similarly increased sensitivity to PAH toxicity (Incardona et al., 2006). There are no similar published findings that may suggest a plausible hypothesis underlying this effect. A BLAST search against the current zebrafish genome database with this sequence reveals only two anonymous sequences that have a partial (19 base pair) overlapwith themorpholino target sequence. Therefore, the control morpholino cannot be targeting a known member of the AHR or cytochrome P450 family. The observed synergism cannot be due to a generalmetabolic property ofmorpholinos, because the effectwas sequence-specific, i.e. did not occurwith either the ahr2-specific negative control morpholino, or the ahr2 antisense morpholino. The PAH compositions derived from non-point sources such as stormwater runoff are complex and typically reflect a mixture of com- bustive and petrogenic sources (Hwang and Foster, 2006; Stein et al., 2006). Comparison of dissolved-phase and particulate-associated PAHs usually shows a predominance of 2- and 3-ring compounds in the dis- solved phase, with a predominance of 4-, 5-, and 6-ring compounds in the particulate fraction. While the bulk of larger particle-associated PAHs may not be bioavailable to organisms such as fish embryos that are primarily impacted bydissolved PAHs (Carls et al., 2008), a key ques- tion is how lower concentrations of compounds such as BaP and BkF might modify the toxicity of a mixture that is otherwise predominantly petrogenic. Because CYP1A induction is primarily protective against pet- rogenic PAH toxicity (Hicken et al., 2011; Incardona et al., 2005), the presence of low concentrations of potent CYP1A inducers could poten- tially reduce the effects of 3-ring compounds in amixture. Alternatively, if CYP1A metabolic capacity was already overwhelmed by higher con- centrations of low molecular weight PAHs (which occurs at about 10 \u03bcg/L in zebrafish; (Hicken et al., 2011), the high molecular weight compounds may produce additive or greater-than-additive (i.e., syner- gistic) impacts on cardiac function and morphogenesis. The finding that the various mixtures of BeP, BaP, and BkF did not produce interme- diate levels of toxicity suggests that there may be more complicated in- teractions between these compounds, which should be examined in more detailed studies. In conclusion, these findings refine and extend our understanding of how individual PAHs cause developmental toxicity via a diversity of tox- icokinetic and toxicodynamic processes. This understanding is critical for assessing the combinatorial toxicity of PAHmixtures in aquatic hab- itats, both within and between petrogenic and pyrogenic sources. There are numerous implications for improving environmental assessment in PAH-contaminated environments. This includes, for example, future as- sessments of oil spill impacts (primarily petrogenic PAH mixtures) in riverine, estuarine, or coastal marine habitats where inputs from urban stormwater runoff (primarily pyrogenic mixtures) are common. A long-term goal of this work is to develop mechanism-based markers of the biological effects of complex PAHmixtures in sensitive early life his- tory stages of fish. This goal is dependent on a detailed understanding of the various pathways through which PAH toxicity converges on the de- veloping fish heart. Although the results of our zebrafish screening approach with high concentrations of single compounds may not be environmentally relevant, they shed light on pathways (e.g. AHR- dependent and novel AHR-independent) for which gene expression markers can be developed and tested with real-world mixtures. These types of mechanistic analyses using the zebrafish model will ultimately inform the development of a new generation of biomarkers that will be diagnostic of different types of PAH exposures in fish spawning habitats and, at the same time, phenotypically anchored to cardiac performance, heart and vascular development, and fish survival.

The standard control morpholino targets a splice site in the human \u00df-globin gene, has no antisense activity in zebrafish cells, and was selected for its absence of off-target biological activity or toxicity (Lacerra et al., 2000) (http://www.gene-tools.com/ node/23#standardcontrols). Some morpholinos have been shown to produce off-target toxicity causing apoptotic cell death through the p53 pathway (Robu et al., 2007). We have used the standard control morpholino with several other PAHs, and have not observed a similarly increased sensitivity to PAH toxicity (Incardona et al., 2006). There are no similar published findings that may suggest a plausible hypothesis underlying this effect. A BLAST search against the current zebrafish genome database with this sequence reveals only two anonymous sequences that have a partial (19 base pair) overlapwith themorpholino target sequence. Therefore, the control morpholino cannot be targeting a known member of the AHR or cytochrome P450 family. The observed synergism cannot be due to a generalmetabolic property ofmorpholinos, because the effectwas sequence-specific, i.e. did not occurwith either the ahr2-specific negative control morpholino, or the ahr2 antisense morpholino. The PAH compositions derived from non-point sources such as stormwater runoff are complex and typically reflect a mixture of com- bustive and petrogenic sources (Hwang and Foster, 2006; Stein et al., 2006). Comparison of dissolved-phase and particulate-associated PAHs usually shows a predominance of 2- and 3-ring compounds in the dis- solved phase, with a predominance of 4-, 5-, and 6-ring compounds in the particulate fraction. While the bulk of larger particle-associated PAHs may not be bioavailable to organisms such as fish embryos that are primarily impacted bydissolved PAHs (Carls et al., 2008), a key ques- tion is how lower concentrations of compounds such as BaP and BkF might modify the toxicity of a mixture that is otherwise predominantly petrogenic. Because CYP1A induction is primarily protective against pet- rogenic PAH toxicity (Hicken et al., 2011; Incardona et al., 2005), the presence of low concentrations of potent CYP1A inducers could poten- tially reduce the effects of 3-ring compounds in amixture. Alternatively, if CYP1A metabolic capacity was already overwhelmed by higher con- centrations of low molecular weight PAHs (which occurs at about 10 \u03bcg/L in zebrafish; (Hicken et al., 2011), the high molecular weight compounds may produce additive or greater-than-additive (i.e., syner- gistic) impacts on cardiac function and morphogenesis. The finding that the various mixtures of BeP, BaP, and BkF did not produce interme- diate levels of toxicity suggests that there may be more complicated in- teractions between these compounds, which should be examined in more detailed studies. In conclusion, these findings refine and extend our understanding of how individual PAHs cause developmental toxicity via a diversity of tox- icokinetic and toxicodynamic processes. This understanding is critical for assessing the combinatorial toxicity of PAHmixtures in aquatic hab- itats, both within and between petrogenic and pyrogenic sources. There are numerous implications for improving environmental assessment in PAH-contaminated environments. This includes, for example, future as- sessments of oil spill impacts (primarily petrogenic PAH mixtures) in riverine, estuarine, or coastal marine habitats where inputs from urban stormwater runoff (primarily pyrogenic mixtures) are common. A long-term goal of this work is to develop mechanism-based markers of the biological effects of complex PAHmixtures in sensitive early life his- tory stages of fish. This goal is dependent on a detailed understanding of the various pathways through which PAH toxicity converges on the de- veloping fish heart. Although the results of our zebrafish screening approach with high concentrations of single compounds may not be environmentally relevant, they shed light on pathways (e.g. AHR- dependent and novel AHR-independent) for which gene expression markers can be developed and tested with real-world mixtures. These types of mechanistic analyses using the zebrafish model will ultimately inform the development of a new generation of biomarkers that will be diagnostic of different types of PAH exposures in fish spawning habitats and, at the same time, phenotypically anchored to cardiac performance, heart and vascular development, and fish survival.

Our results show a progressive increase in arterial pressure that is already evident at the onset of ethanol con- sumption. Increased vascular responsiveness to vasoconstrictor agents may contribute to the increase in blood pressure, possibly establishing a link factor in thehypertension development induced by ethanol inges- tion. Baroreflex changes were secondary to hypertension, but may con- tribute to maintain the hypertensive state and the increased risk of cardiac events in later stages of ethanol ingestion. The present study provides the first evidence of alterations in angiotensinergic mecha- nisms and CNP content within the NTS of ethanol-treated rats, which may be related to autonomic changes, as well as to neuroendocrine ef- fects evoked by ethanol. Finally, facilitated vascular responsiveness to NO seems to be an important mechanism counteracting ethanol- induced hypertension during later phases of ethanol ingestion.

Consequently, efforts to engineer new cardioprotective agents should focus on maximizing the antioxidant and not necessarily the autonomic properties of the drug. The results offer important substantiation for using this pharmacologically active agent as an adjunct to minimize the mitochondrial cardiomyopathy that limits the therapeutic success of DOX antineoplastic therapy.

As the human body burden of the three PCB congeners used in this study varies considerably by individual and tissue, and it is difficult to extrapolate from in vitro to in vivo, the doses in our study were chosen to approximate human levels. (Freels et al., 2007; Park et al., 2007; Larsen et al., 1994; Lanting et al., 1998). Because PCBs differentially accumulate into microenvironments in living tissues, with levels reaching approximately 50 ppb in neonatal human brains (Lanting et al., 1998), developing neurons may be exposed to micromolar concentrations of these toxicants. This study establishes the role of PCBs in the induction of apoptosis in GnRH GT1-7 cells as a model for developing hypothalamic neurons. Future experiments in animal models will apply the present observations in GT1-7 cells on the effects of PCB exposure to the developing GnRH neurosecretory system.

One of the consequences of DNA adduct formation is the clastogenic effect. When a sample such as C. sylvestris ethanolic ex- tract is able to decrease the number of micronuclei, it acts against ir- reparable DNA damage, which is manifested as chromosome aberrations or aneugenic effects, including clastogenicity (Scolastici et al., 2008). However, the comet assay detects primary DNA lesions that are reparable (Scolastici et al., 2008). In the present study, C. sylvestris ethanolic extract and casearin X both reduced the extent of such damage. Given that casearin X, a clerodane diterpene, did not reduce the percentage of micronuclei, another class of com- pounds must be responsible for this effect of C. sylvestris ethanolic ex- tract. The essential oil of C. sylvestris has also been shown to protect DNA from clastogenic damage, having been found to contain mono- terpenes and sesquiterpenes (Sousa et al., 2007). Oliveira et al. (2009) identified sesquiterpenes and clerodane diterpenes in the ethanolic extract of C. sylvestris. Of the 15 sesquiterpenes identified in the ethanolic extract, 13 had previously been identified in the essential oil (Esteves et al., 2005; Sousa et al., 2007). The protective effect of C. sylvestris ethanolic extract against irreparable DNA damage might be related also to its sesquiterpene content. In the present study, we observed that C. sylvestris ethanolic extract and casearin X have chemopreventive activity against DNA damage induced by TSP emitted from sugarcane burning. Our results suggest that C. sylvestris extract and diterpenes can act by different mechanisms to protect DNA against damage, including repairable and non-repairable damages.

Riezzo et al. / Toxicology and Applied Pharmacology 280 (2014) 97\u2013106 Our previous study showed that high AASs doses administered over a long period is responsible for selective nephrotoxicity. This was dem- onstrated using the most common immunohistochemical and proteo- mic methods (D'Errico et al., 2011). Damaged, misfolded proteins bind to chaperones, and liberate the heat shock factor (HSF) from its chaper- one complexes. HSF is activated and the transcription of chaperone genes takes place (Morimoto, 2002; Soti and Csermely, 2003). Suscepti- bility to various types of proteotoxic damage is mainly increased due to the dysfunction ofmitochondrial oxidation. Collectively, these data sug- gest that TNF-\u03b1 mediated injury due to nandrolone decanoate in renal cells appears to play a role in the activation of both the intrinsic and ex- trinsic pathways of apoptosis during long periods of injury. It is unlikely that TNF-\u03b1 has a single effect to induce glomerulus cell apoptosis. The evidence gathered in this study clearly shows that multiple pathways could be activated in TNF-\u03b1-induced apoptosis in the glomerulus. It is likely that after long durations of injury, there is an oxidant-mediated activation of mitochondrial-derived apoptosis, with a switch to TNF-\u03b1 receptor-mediated apoptosis following longer periods of injury (Maenpaa et al., 2008). Our experimental studies have confirmed the overexpression on mesangial cells of HSP90, IL-1\u03b2 and TNF-\u03b1 with in- tense reaction, in trained mice treated with high doses of nandrolone decanoate. In conclusion, the nephrotoxicity induced in nandrolone- treatedmice is closely associatedwith considerable dose-related oxida- tive stress.

Importantly, most studies to date have focused on the effect of arsenic alone and not taken into consid- eration risk-modifying factors. Furthermore, even fewer studies have tested the possibility that arsenic may be a risk modifying factor for other diseases. It was shown here that arsenic enhances experimental NAFLD in mice. Although the increase in liver injury caused by arsenic under these conditions, NAFLD is a chronic disease that requires sev- eral years to progress (Adams et al., 2005), so relatively small changes can be greatly amplified over time. These results therefore suggest that the relative risk of hepatic damage caused by arsenic exposure may have to be modified to take into account other mitigating factors, such as underlying fatty liver disease.

We suggest that chrysin reduces histamine release via regulating intracellular calcium and inhibits inflammatory cytokines through suppressing caspase-1 and NF-\u03baB. We provide evidence that chrysin could contribute to the prevention or treatment of mast cell-mediated allergic inflammatory disorders.
