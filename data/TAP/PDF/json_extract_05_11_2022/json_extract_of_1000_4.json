We showed that the TrkA pathway was an early target of MeHg, and that suppression of the TrkA pathway resulted in neuritic degeneration followed by apoptosis. GM1 ganglio- side and its analog, MCC-257, suppressed MeHg-induced neuronal degeneration and apoptotic cell death through the activation of the TrkA pathway in vitro. The effect of MCC-257 on MeHg-intoxication was confirmed clinically and pathologically in a MeHg-intoxicated rat model. Our results suggest that the TrkA pathway is an early target of MeHg, and that compounds that enhance activation of the TrkA path- way are useful against MeHg-induced neuronal degeneration.

It should be noted that recent studies of several newborn cohorts in Brazil, China, Japan, Spain, and the USA reveal higher mean concentrations of Hg in blood cord: in the range 8\u201317 \u03bcg/L (equivalent to 40\u201385 nM) (Fok et al., 2007; Oliveira Santos et al., 2007; Sakamoto et al., 2007; Lederman et al., 2008; Ram\u00f3n et al., 2008). Therefore, the findings of this study may be relevant to human exposure to methylmercury worldwide. It is noteworthy that low nanomolar concentrations of methylmercury have also been found to impair the neuronal differentiating potential of cultured neural stem cells (Tamm et al., 2006). In conclusion, we have found that the cofilin phosphorylation balance is altered in cerebellar granule neurons exposed to low concentrations of methylmercury. This alteration was produced earlier than cytotoxic effects were observed in the cells, suggesting that cofilin might be an early target of methylmercury neurotoxicity.

Both of these drugs possess a risk of hepatic fat accumulation (France, 2016). Mipomersen is an injectable drug, while lomitapide is orally efficacious. MTP inhibition blocks assembly and secretion of apolipo- proteins leading to accumulation of lipids in liver and may cause fatty liver. In individuals with familial hypercholesterolemia, lomitapide effectively reduces serum lipids, but is associated with elevated liver aminotransferases levels in serum presumably due to hepatic fat accu- mulation and associated hepatocellular injury. This leads to decreased patient compliance to lomitapide therapy (Yoshida, 2017). Selective intestinal inhibitors of MTP like slx-4090 and JTT-130 were previously observed to reduce the side effect of MTP inhibition but were unsuc- cessful in clinical trials. Thyroid hormones especially T3, decrease serum and hepatic lipids and increase \u00df-oxidation of accumulated fat in the liver (Joharapurkar et al., 2012). Triiodothyronine (T3) and thyroxine (T4) are two hormones produced and released by the thyroid gland. T4 is converted to T3 by deiodinase. T3 is the biologically active that binds to thyroid hormone receptors (TR). T4 must be converted to T3 in order to elicit biological activity. Both would have similar effect, but T3 is more potent than T4 (Abdalla and Bianco, 2014). It also increases the synthesis of bile salt from accumulated lipids. We hypothesized that the lipid lowering actions of thyroid hormone may prove to be complimentary to lomitapide treatment. The Zucker fatty rat, a model of metabolic syndrome, shows hyperlipidemia associated with obesity and insulin resistance (Wong et al., 2016). Treatment with triiodothyronine in combination with lomitapide in Zucker fatty rats caused a decrease in body weight, cholesterol, LDL, and glucose during OGTT which was greater in effect than either lomitapide or T3 treatment alone. This fatty rat model is known to respond to lomitapide treatment (Dhote et al., 2011). Lomitapide caused a reduction in food intake, whereas T3 increased it. However, the combination of T3 with lomita- pide caused profound suppression of body weight gain without a sig- nificant change in food intake. Triiodothyronine treatment improves glucose intolerance in obese rats (Vazquez-Anaya et al., 2017). Lomi- tapide is also reported to improve glucose intolerance in Zucker fatty rats (Dhote et al., 2011). The combination of T3 with lomitapide had an additive effect on glucose tolerance. In this study, lomitapide treatment reduced serum triglyceride levels, though addition of T3 had little additional impact on this effect. Treatment with T3 and lomitapide alone reduced serum total cholesterol and LDL. However, combination treat- ment resulted in greater reduction in total cholesterol and LDL than either T3 or lomitapide treatment alone.", "Acknowledgement": "Acknowledgement Authors are grateful to Mr. Pankaj R.

Similarly, we observed that minocycline blocked expression of both MMP (Fig. 5) and iNOS (Fig. 6), which makes minocycline an attractive alternative for treatment of IBD. Interestingly, minocycline also has protective effects against arthritis and skin diseases such as pyoderma gangrenosum, both of which are extraintestinal manifes- tations associated with patients with IBD (Barrie and Regueiro, 2007). In addition, minocycline has recently been proven to have promising long-term therapeutic effects on rheumatoid arthritis with no obvious side effects (Stone et al., 2003). Given its moderate toxicity and relatively low cost, detailed studies on the mode of action of minocycline treatment and clinical trials using human IBD patients are warranted.

Mitochondrial oxidative stress may be a major contributing factor to NRTI-induced toxicity, may be potentiated by other factors that generate mitochondrial oxidative stress such as HIV infection, coinfections, aging, and alcohol use, and may be a target for pharmacological intervention to increase antiviral efficacy.

The placement of a local system to regulate mitochondrial BR homeostasis is perhaps to protect the organelles against ROS generated bymitochondrial respi- ration and from exposure to toxic chemicals. Our future studies aim at further understanding the role of mitochondrial BR regulating enzyme system in cytoprotection and in mitochondria associated diseases.

In the body, chemicals are chemicals, and risk of harm is driven by potency and exposure. The natural:synthetic distinction may serve political and funding objectives, but availability of funding appears to have grossly distorted the balance of toxicological research toward synthetic chemicals. Using synthetic pesticide residues in foods as a point of reference, it is apparent that there are far higher levels of natural toxicants in food than of synthetic pesticide residues. Ames (1983) estimated that \u201c\u2026 dietary intake of \u2018natures pesticides\u2019 is likely to be several grams per day\u2013probably at least 10,000 times higher than the dietary intake of man-made pesticides\u201d (p. 1258). Beier and Nigg (2001) estimated that people might consume 60 ug per day of synthetic pesticides and herbicides, while natural pesticide consumption is about 4.8 to 6 million ug/day. \u201cThese numbers result in a natural pesticide potential of 80,000 to 100,000 times that of synthetic chemicals in the diet\u201d (p. 132). Although the exposure estimates of Ames (1983) and Beier and Nigg (2001) contrast natural and synthetic pesticides, the important point is not limited to pesticides. The point is that people are exposed to large amounts of natural toxicants in their daily lives, and the risk implications of these exposures are largely ignored in contemporary toxicology. Essers et al. (1998) recommended that \u201cin light of the small safety margins for many inherent toxicants in plant food, there is a need for more accurate risk assessments of these substances in food. There is very little data on these substances\u201d (p. 170). Essers et al. make several recommendations on how to address food safety, and propose that priorities should driven by the severity of the health risk involved, the degree of human exposure, and the feasibility of conducting a useful study."}},

The mechanisms are related to conspicuous alteration to DNA oxidative base modifications in the nucleus of hepatocytes via generation of oxidative stress due to the activation of CAR, PXR and PPARswith a sequence of eventswhichpresumably lead to regenerative cell proliferation. The MOA of ETBE hepatotumorigenicity in rats is un- likely to be relevant to humans.

It is therefore difficult to ascribe arising SSBs to the intermediates of DNA repair (as SSBs reflect levels of DNA strand breaks, apurinic/ apyrimidinic sites as well as intermediates in the repair process (Collins, 2009). Among the analyzed confounders the only significant correlation was detected between smoking and XPC expression. This finding is in accordance with a recent study, where XPC mRNA levels induced by ionizing radiation were substantially affected by smoking (Wiebalk et al., 2007). This present study has an advantage of investigating the end- points of styrene genotoxicity in relation with DNA repair capacity and simultaneous measurement of mRNA expression levels in three relevant DNA repair genes. The selection of DNA repair genes of interest was based on our previous studies (Vodicka et al., 2004b, 2007), reporting the links between genotypes in XRCC1, hOGG1, and, partially, XPC and \u03b3-irradiation-specific DNA repair rates. Obtained data may contribute to our understanding of styrene- induced genotoxicity and the response of DNA repair system, assayed for by the determination of mRNA expression levels of XRCC1, hOGG1 and XPC genes, and BER rates. Understanding themolecular responses to genotoxic stress requires further highly-targeted study, aimed mainly at discerning the role of DNA damage sensing, DNA repair pathways (functional tests) and the regulation, function and modification of the relevant proteins/enzymes at the protein level in the cells following the exposure to xenobiotics.

The anti-fibrotic properties of mirtazapine can be attributed, at least in part, to down-regulating TGF- \u03b21 induced Smads and ERK1/2 signaling pathways and attenuating ox- idative stress. Treatment of liver fibrosis with specific antagonists of 5- HT2A receptor may offer a new therapeutic approach in humans, which needs to be assessed in further studies. A critical next step is to generate a tissue-specific agent that targets 5-HT2A receptor and does not cross the blood-brain-barrier. This should minimize the potential for psychotropic side effects.

These changes affected marks that activate and repress gene expression, leading to DNA hypermethyla- tion in tumor suppressor genes and DNA hypomethylation in other genes that may promote tumorigenesis as well as tumor progression. Thus, further analysis using primary lung epithelial cells will provide more insights into the epigenetic mechanism underlying tumorigeni- city of Cr(VI). A more detailed analysis of genome-wide and gene- specific changes in these active and repressive marks will significantly add to our understanding of chromate cytotoxicity, genotoxicity, and carcinogenicity.

Changes in expression of proteins such as Hsp27, p53, and c-Jun implicate the function of multiple signaling pathways. Future studies on the role of these signaling pathways will provide further insight into the regulation of these responses to toxicant exposure and will suggest approaches to ameliorating the toxic effects.

Prominent protein levels of Wnt5a/b, Wnt3a, GSK-3\u03b2 and \u03b2-catenin in untreated LX-2 cells demonstrated the active participation of Wnt signaling in cultured LX-2 cells. Morin treatment (50 \u03bcM) for 24 and 48 h resulted in the decreased levels of Wnt5a/b, Wnt3a, GSK-3\u03b2 and \u03b2-catenin along with G0/G1 specific cell cycle arrest suggesting the inhibition of HSC proliferation bymorin by inhibitingWnt signaling. In addition to the remarkable effects of morin on HSC proliferation and inhibition of Wnt signaling pathway, further investigations to explore its effects on non-canonical signaling pathways are recommended. In DEN induced group, the elevation of \u03b2-catenin and its target gene cyclin D1 along with prominent cytosolic and nuclear \u03b2-catenin expression warrants the active participation of canonicalWnt pathway. Also, signif- icant downregulation of GSK-3\u03b2, \u03b2-catenin and its associated proteins bymorin treatment in the protective group and therapeutic group dem- onstrated the anti-fibrotic potential of morin by inhibiting Wnt signal- ing. Hence, the effects of morin shown in this study may provide important insights for the use of morin as a potential integrated medi- cine for the treatment of liver fibrosis.

Rheuben et al. / Toxicology and Applied Pharmacology 196 (2004) 266\u2013286 285 In summary, the combined evidence of this study and the data published previously suggests that regulated quantal release, and possibly constitutive release, and the interlinked process of recycling of the associated synaptic vesicle membrane, are ultimately targets of DTB toxicity at the onset of muscle weakness. At the present time, we cannot say whether the steps that lead to defects in release or recycling arise first within the terminal or if they are a result of some other process. Sahenk (1990) noticed abnormalities in the intramuscular axons, and it is possible, for example, that axonal transport of new synaptic vesicles is disturbed, leading to a gradually declining population of useable vesicles. Although the terminal Schwann cells do change dramatically, and their participation in this process should not be excluded, the structural changes are not supportive of the idea that they contribute substantially to the physiolog- ical findings at the onset of muscle weakness.

As a community, we should strive for drugs like erlotinib, which showed minimal cardiotoxicity across all tests in our screen that improve patient outcome but do not add an additional risk of cardiac adverse events. The ability to thoroughly screen a library of compounds early in pre-clinical development would allow for the selection of those that have minimal cardiotoxicity or are perhaps even cardioprotective to be moved forward into clinical trials. Thus, earlier identification of pos- sible deleterious effects on the heart would likely improve drug candi- date success in clinical trials and offer patients safer therapies.

The results of the IPA also indicate that MWCNT exposure may induce alterations in several disease-related signaling transduction pathways. In light of this finding, long term inhalation studies of MWCNT to monitor possible induction of lung tumors and/or mesothelioma are justified. NIOSH is currently conducting a two week inhalation exposure to MWCNT in a cancer susceptible mouse strain with histological evaluation through 1 year post-exposure to address this issue. Additionally, the results obtained from this study indicate these gene signature alterations of MWCNT exposure and could conceivably be used for the medical surveillance of occupationally-exposed MWCNT workers.

Further, it can be reasonably argued that generation of oxidative stress and neuronal apoptotic cell death might constitute the intervening biochemical steps between chronic exposure to SM and appearance of various neurobehavioral deficits. More research in this area is needed to gain a better understanding of the consequences and mechanisms associated with chronic sulphur mustard exposure by employing various antioxidants and inhibitors of caspases to observe any amelioration in sulphur mustard mediated neurotoxicity.

Growth arrest-promoting effects of HIF-1\u03b1 mediated via induction of CDK inhibitors or other mechanisms are not compatible with uncontrolled proliferation of cancer cells. Therefore, it appears that transformed cells evolved to suppress the growth-inhibitory com- ponent of HIF-1\u03b1-mediated signalingwhile retaining beneficial proper- ties of hypoxic metabolism (high glucose uptake, for example). This selective loss of HIF-1\u03b1 functions in cancer helps explain why the ab- sence of HIF-1\u03b1 had no effect on Ni cytotoxicity in H460 and A549 car- cinoma cells but suppressed Ni-induced cytotoxicity and senescence in normal human cells. Although HIF-1\u03b1 is frequently described as an on- cogene due to its promotion of many cancer characteristics (Wilson and Hay, 2011), this classification may be appropriate only for advanced stages of cell transformation. In renal cell carcinoma that are caused by the inactivation of the HIF-1\u03b1/HIF-2\u03b1 E3 ubiquitin ligase VHL, ex- pression of HIF-1\u03b1 is almost always lost and it is viewed as a tumor sup- pressor (Shen and Kaelin, 2013). Our findings in normal cells suggest that in the early phase of Ni carcinogenesis, HIF-1\u03b1 may also operate in a tumor suppressor-like manner acting to restrict proliferation of se- verely damaged cells.

Superoxide production in directly activated monocytes was negatively associated with AsU but positively associated with PbB. The models including the interaction term for AsU and PbB suggested the possi- bility of a negative interaction for NO production and a positive interaction for superoxide. These effects may pro- vide an explanation for some of the abnormalities of the immune system functioning associated with an increased incidence of infectious disease, cancer and/or aberrant humoral immunity in exposed human populations. Further studies in larger populations are required to characterize and understand the interactions between As and Pb and the mechanism(s) underlying the observed effects.

Cockburn et al. / Toxicology and Applied Pharmacology 270 (2013) 209\u2013217 can overwhelm the normal the process of anabolism to ammonia, resulting in the potential for significant systemic exposure to nitrite and MetHb formation. NOAELs for nitrite intake for pigs and cows have been estimated from the literature at approximately 3.3 mg/kg b.w. per day for both species. The total nitrite intake for pigs and cattle consuming complete feed containing nitrite at the maximum limit under EU legislation was found to be 9-fold and 5-fold lower than the NOAEL. Based on the bulkiness of animal feed this represents a satisfactory margin of safety to protect animal health and welfare. Despite the very limited quantitative information on nitrite residues in fresh animal products the evidence indicates that the potential for accumulation of nitrite in animal tissues is very low. This is due to its rapid metabolic turnover and excretion. Separate calculations, based on dietary surveys conducted in EU Member States, showed that compared with the total daily exposure to nitrite, most of nitrite exposure derives from inter- conversion from nitrate contained in fruit and vegetables, fresh animal products contribute a maximum of 2.9% of the total daily exposure to nitrite. It is concluded that such a contribution of nitrite from animal products does not raise any concern for human health. Conflict of interest No competing interests between the authors were identified.

Patient safety data from clinical trials is consistent with the toxicity findings from the nonclinical studies, and these findings are in turn consistent with the pharmacology of the target. Bone marrow toxicity, in particular thrombocytopenia and neutropenia, appeared to be the dose-limiting toxicities observed in a phase 1 trial with OTX015 (Thieblemont et al., 2014). While these adverse effects are not unexpected given the available nonclinical data generated in vitro and in vivo with various BET inhibitors, it does suggest the probable lack of a sufficient therapeutic index for BET inhibitors for non-oncology disease indications. The 30 mg/kg BID oral dose level of JQ1 has been shown to be efficacious in mouse models of anti- inflammation for immunology and atherosclerosis formetabolic disease (internal observations, data not shown). However, although this dose was tolerated, it was also associated with toxic effects on lymphocytes in the thymus and spleen and corresponding hematology changes. Overall our findings reveal that BET inhibition affects the lymphoid and hematopoietic tissue compartments in the mouse, indicating that there are very narrow safety margins. As the medicinal chemistry research for BET inhibitors expands and better selectivity and potency are gained, it will be interesting to determine if a selective inhibitor for BRD2 would have a better safety profile compared to BRD4 or vice- versa for a non-oncology indication.

Nrf2 deficiency improves glu- cose tolerance in mice fed a HFD, whereas Nrf2 activation worsens glucose tolerance in mice fed either a control diet or a HFD. The effect of Nrf2 on glucose homeostasis appears to be mediated by its negative regulation of the anti-diabetic hormone Fgf21 in liver, as well as its ef- fects on cell metabolism pathways that interact with reactive oxygen species.

Arsenic appeared to bemore toxic to Nrf2\u2212/\u2212mice compared to Nrf2+/+mice, as measured by physiological changes, DNA methylation, oxidative DNA damage, and apoptotic cell death. Arsenic caused detectable physiologic alterations, especially in the liver and bladder in both Nrf2 +/+ and Nrf2\u2212/\u2212 mice. Although skin damage is frequently observed in the arsenic-exposed population, we did not observe any skin lesions during the course of our study. Two rational reasons can be envisioned: (1) in addition to exposure through drinking water, human exposure to arsenic also includes direct contact with the skin; however, in our study arsenic was solely administered through the digestive system, and (2) the duration of arsenic exposure was not long enough to induce skin damage. More importantly, these results indicate a protective role of Nrf2 against arsenic toxicity in vivo. Therefore, we believe that specific activation of the ARE\u2013Nrf2\u2013Keap1 pathway by a reagent with low toxicity should be a great strategy to combat arsenic-induced damage. Our findings will lay the ground- work for dietary and therapeutic interventions against arsenic adverse effects.

Our results showed that pretreatment with OCA protected mice from CCl4-induced hepatocyte apoptosis and necrosis. We found that pretreatment with OCA down-regulated hepatic inflam- matory chemokine and pro-inflammatory cytokines but up-regulated hepatic anti-inflammatory cytokines during CCl4-induced acute liver in- jury. We demonstrated that pretreatment with OCA, which activated hepatic FXR signaling, simultaneously inhibited CCl4-induced activation of hepatic inflammatory signaling. Our results provide evidence for roles of FXR as an important regulator of hepatic inflammation during toxin-induced acute liver injury. Thus, synthetic FXR agonists including OCA are effective antidotes for hepatic inflammation during acute liver injury.

Alternative approaches e.g. global gene expression analysis, quanti- tative metabolite (including neurotransmitter and lipids) and proteomic profiling of the retina, or more sophisticated techniques like high spatial resolution quantitative imaging analysis based on mass spectrometry might provide additional mechanistic insights (Anderson et al., 2014; Magharious et al., 2011; Tan et al., 2016).

These findings are in-line with previous work, in which OFC supplementation was shown to protect against direct effects of HFD on the gutmicrobiome and barrier function (Cani et al., 2007). Prebiotics favor an environment inwhich commensal bacteria can thrive, in lieu of direct delivery of commensal bacteria (i.e., probiotics). As such, this approach may yield more predictable and stable results. Nevertheless, these results serve proof-of-principle that protecting against microbiome changes caused by arsenic can prevent the enhancement of inflammatory liver injury caused by this environmental contaminant.

Thus, Oatp1b2, OATP1B1, and OATP1B3 are responsible for uptake of microcystin-LR into rat and human hepatocytes, respectively, while OATP1A2 mediates microcystin-LR transport across the blood\u2013brain barrier. The reduced microcystin-LR toxicity in Oatp/OATP-expressing oocytes co-incubated with BSP and TC indicates that administration of high affinity co-substrates of OATP1B1, OATP1B3, and OATP1A2 could provide a therapeutic option to reduce liver damage or neurotoxicity in microcystin-intoxicated patients.

However, based on studies in ventilated animals in which these insults have been analyzed individually, it appears that hyperoxia is the most important trigger of pathologic changes associated with BPD and that high levels of inspired oxygen potentiate injury induced by volume and pres- sure during ventilation of the premature neonatal lung (Delemos et al., 1987; Davis et al., 1991). Consistent with this idea is the observation that exposure of neonatal mice to 85% oxygen for 28 days resulted in decreased lung cell prolifera- tion, an accumulation of inflammatory cells in the tissue, and increased pulmonary interleukin (IL)-1\ufffd and macrophage in- flammatory protein-1\ufffd production. This is associated with de- creased lung volume and compliance and a pathologic lesion very similar to BPD (Warner et al., 1998). Similarly, Han et al. (1996) reported that exposure of neonatal rats to 60% oxygen for 2 weeks resulted in lesions resembling BPD. Interestingly, exposure to higher levels of inspired oxygen resulted in exces- sive toxicity and arrest of lung cell DNA synthesis rather than BPD-like changes. This suggests that there is a limited range of oxygen concentrations that can trigger BPD, even in the pres- ence of less than maximal support, consistent with the new epidemiology of BPD. A role for oxygen in BPD is also supported by the finding that morphologic changes in the lung associated with BPD are mitigated by agents that reduce oxi- dative injury (superoxide dismutase and catalase) (Wilborn et al., 1996). Recent investigations have focused on elucidating cellular and physiologic mechanisms that mediate oxygen- induced edema and fibrosis. Several potential mechanisms have been identified: dysregulated inflammation, altered pro- tease/antiprotease balance, and/or altered growth and differen- tiation of lung cells. Dysregulated inflammation. Prolonged exposure to in- haled oxygen is characterized by rapid neutrophil infiltration into the lung. Bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) neutrophil counts"}},

To our knowledge, this Fig. 8. Overview of PTP research may be the first report involved in the expression and role of PTP1B in liver fibrosis. In this study, blockade of PTP1B inhibits TGF-\u03b2- induced HShuang-Peng Cai-T6 cell activation and proliferation, while over- expression of PTP1B hinders the inactivation of HShuang-Peng Cai-T6 cells (Fig. 8). These results indicate the potential of PTP1B as a therapeutic target for liver fibrosis. Pharmacological agents that inhibit PTP1Bmight be a per- spective regarding treatment of liver fibrosis. Therefore, designing and developing PTP1B inhibitors with extremely high potency and selectiv- ity and directing the agents to the location of interest are of great signif- icance for remedying fibrosis. Nevertheless, the fundamental mechanism of PTP1B in the setting of liver fibrosis thus far is incom- pletely understood. Next, studies applied in vitro and in vivo techniques will be conducted urgently to explore the mechanism, especially the substrates and signaling pathways that are regulated by PTP1B. Looking to the future, we will have a better picture of the complex function and mechanism of PTP1B in liver fibrosis, which could be of great signifi- cance in predicting the pace of disease progression and developing the targeted therapeutic medicines.

A recent study in HeLa cells has shown that PON2 binds to Coenzyme Q10 that associates with complex III in mitochondria, and that PON2 deficiency causes mitochondrial dysfunc- tion (Devarajan et al., 2011). Furthermore, in human endothelial cells, PON2 has been shown to reduce, indirectly, but specifically, the release of superoxide from the inner mitochondrial membrane, without affecting levels of other radicals such as H2O2 and peroxynitrite (Altenhofer et al., 2010). Interestingly, the Cys311Ser mutation that influences lactonase activity (Stoltz et al., 2009) does not appear to affect PON2's antioxidantproperties, suggesting independenthydrolytic and anti-oxidant functions (Altenhofer et al., 2010).

Following chronic, low-level MMAIII exposure in URO-MSC cells, DNA damage in the presence of MMAIII is significantly elevated after 12 weeks and remains elevated through 52 weeks. Upon removal of MMAIII for 2 weeks, DNA damage levels in URO-MSC cells remain elevated and increase in a time- dependent manner when compared to control UROtsa despite the absence of MMAIII. Yamauchi et al. (2004) demonstrated that the length of inorganic arsenic exposure dictates the ability of individuals to recover from oxidative DNA damage. In the URO-MSC(\u2212) cells following previous chronic, low-level exposure DNA damage levels remain elevated, possibly due to an increase in the length of time necessary to recover. The decreased levels of PARP activity in the presence of MMAIII may also explain the significantly elevated levels of DNA damage first occurring at 12 weeks in the presence of 50 nM MMAIII. When MMAIII is removed for 2 weeks, a time-dependent increase in PARP activity may account for the decrease in DNA damage levels in URO-MSC(\u2212) cells out of MMAIII exposure. Taken together, the increased DNA damage as a result of MMAIII-induced ROS in concert with an overall decrease in repair capacity in the presence of MMAIII may play a key role in generating an indirect genotoxic insult and an overall contribution in the progression of arsenic-induced bladder carcinogenesis.

However, at lower doses, most likely to be encountered in both occupational- and environmental-related exposures, the pharmacokinetics are expected to be linear. A dose-dependent inhibition of ChE activity was also noted in plasma, RBC, and brain for both the single and coexposures to CPF and DZN. In all tissues, the overall potency for ChE inhibition was greater for CPF than DZN and the binary mixture response appeared to be strongly influenced by CPF at all doses. A comparison of the ChE response at the low dose (15 mg/ kg) where there are no pharmacokinetic interactions for the binary mixture suggests that the overall ChE response is additive. These experiments provide needed insight for evaluating interactions for binary pesticide mixtures and can be used for assessing the potential cumulative risk associated with occupational or environmental exposures to these insecticides.

Fisher et al. / Toxicology and Applied Pharmacology 257 (2011) 122\u2013136 aggregate U.S. exposure. The claim by Taylor et al. (2011) that 2 ng/ml (8.8 nM) of aglycone BPA in systemic circulation is common in humans is not supported by the findings of Teeguarden et al. (2011) or by this human PBPK model for BPA. An oral bolus BPA dose of 686 \u03bcg/kg of BPA (48,000 \u03bcg BPA for a 70 kg person) would be required to obtain peak serum levels of aglycone BPA near 2 ng/ml because of extensive presystemic metabolism. Given the short systemic half life of BPA be- cause of its rapid metabolism, the upper bound aggregate intake of BPA (\u22641 \u03bcg/kg bw/d; (Calafat et al., 2008; LaKind and Naiman, 2011) and difficulty in reaching a quasi-steady state condition, aglycone BPA serum concentrations of 2 ng/ml appear very unlikely. Given this infor- mation, measured levels of aglycone native BPA in serum of humans mentioned by Taylor et al. (2011) are more plausibly understood as the result of sample contamination, a challenge for every laboratory conducting analyses of BPA samples (Twaddle et al., 2010). The use of non-compartmental pharmacokinetic parameters (NCPPs) to characterize the kinetic data for BPA and its metabolites (e.g., maxi- mum serum concentration or area-under-the-concentration-curve (AUC) for serum) have been used to extrapolate across dose and species. Because of extensive presystemic metabolism of BPA, linearity in NCPPs are apparent for orally administer BPA in several species. The use of this simple methodology for extrapolation across both species and dose is a first-approximation and should be interpreted with care. For example, without capturing the oral uptake phase of systemic aglycone BPA, deter- mining the likely maximum concentration of BPA or the likely AUC for aglycone BPA is difficult. A major portion of the AUC valuemay be repre- sented by the time interval from time of dosing to the first time point in which a serumBPAmeasurement is taken. The trapezoid rule for integra- tion using routine procedures assumes a straight line from time zero (timeof dosing) to thefirstmeasured timepoint, perhapsmissing impor- tant kinetic information. To compare model-predicted metrics across age and species, a sin- gle bolus dose of BPA (100 \u03bcg/kg) was simulated for 24 h in PND 5, 35 and 70 monkeys and in adult monkeys and humans using the cali- brated BPA model. The predicted peak serum level of BPA in the PND 5 monkey was 2 times the BPA concentrations in the older in- fants and adult monkeys, which were similar to each other. The pre- dicted adult human peak BPA serum concentration was somewhat higher (1.3 nM) than the adult monkey (0.87 nM). Significant age- dependent pharmacokinetic behaviors were observed for BPA metab- olites. The peak concentration and AUC values for BPA metabolites declined with age by nearly 2 times and 6 times, respectively, in PND 5 and adult monkeys. The predicted peak concentration and AUC values for BPA metabolites in adult humans were 50% higher and 4 times greater than in adult monkeys. At 24 h after dosing the predicted BPA dose (as BPA metabolites) remaining in the body was 1% in the monkeys, irrespective of age, and 2\u20134% of the dose (as BPA metabolites) remained in the adult humans. The model-predicted adult monkey dosimetrics, for a given dose per kg BW, is not equivalent to an adult human for the BPA metabolites. However, model-predicted peak serum free BPA levels were similar be- tween adultmonkeys and humans, with free BPA 24 h serumAUC values slightly higher (3.7\u20134.0 nM/24 h) than adult monkeys (~2.0 nM/24 h). Extrapolation of NCPPs from adult monkeys to adult humans with as- sumptions about linearity will introduce large errors for BPAmetabolites and until aglycone BPA is measured in human serum, the model predic- tions in this paper, based onmonkey BPA kinetic studies, provide the best estimates of aglycone BPA levels in humans. A controlled human intentional BPA dosing study, similar to the V\u00f6lkel et al. (2002) study, using updated analytical methods, similar to Teeguarden et al. (2011), would provide important information about the serum levels of aglycone BPA. The new human BPA kinetic study could help determine if monkeys and humans process BPA in a similar fashion and provide confidence in the utility of models devel- oped with data obtained in nonhuman primates for human risk assessment.

Fisher et al. / Toxicology and Applied Pharmacology 257 (2011) 122\u2013136 aggregate U.S. exposure. The claim by Taylor et al. (2011) that 2 ng/ml (8.8 nM) of aglycone BPA in systemic circulation is common in humans is not supported by the findings of Teeguarden et al. (2011) or by this human PBPK model for BPA. An oral bolus BPA dose of 686 \u03bcg/kg of BPA (48,000 \u03bcg BPA for a 70 kg person) would be required to obtain peak serum levels of aglycone BPA near 2 ng/ml because of extensive presystemic metabolism. Given the short systemic half life of BPA be- cause of its rapid metabolism, the upper bound aggregate intake of BPA (\u22641 \u03bcg/kg bw/d; (Calafat et al., 2008; LaKind and Naiman, 2011) and difficulty in reaching a quasi-steady state condition, aglycone BPA serum concentrations of 2 ng/ml appear very unlikely. Given this infor- mation, measured levels of aglycone native BPA in serum of humans mentioned by Taylor et al. (2011) are more plausibly understood as the result of sample contamination, a challenge for every laboratory conducting analyses of BPA samples (Twaddle et al., 2010). The use of non-compartmental pharmacokinetic parameters (NCPPs) to characterize the kinetic data for BPA and its metabolites (e.g., maxi- mum serum concentration or area-under-the-concentration-curve (AUC) for serum) have been used to extrapolate across dose and species. Because of extensive presystemic metabolism of BPA, linearity in NCPPs are apparent for orally administer BPA in several species. The use of this simple methodology for extrapolation across both species and dose is a first-approximation and should be interpreted with care. For example, without capturing the oral uptake phase of systemic aglycone BPA, deter- mining the likely maximum concentration of BPA or the likely AUC for aglycone BPA is difficult. A major portion of the AUC valuemay be repre- sented by the time interval from time of dosing to the first time point in which a serumBPAmeasurement is taken. The trapezoid rule for integra- tion using routine procedures assumes a straight line from time zero (timeof dosing) to thefirstmeasured timepoint, perhapsmissing impor- tant kinetic information. To compare model-predicted metrics across age and species, a sin- gle bolus dose of BPA (100 \u03bcg/kg) was simulated for 24 h in PND 5, 35 and 70 monkeys and in adult monkeys and humans using the cali- brated BPA model. The predicted peak serum level of BPA in the PND 5 monkey was 2 times the BPA concentrations in the older in- fants and adult monkeys, which were similar to each other. The pre- dicted adult human peak BPA serum concentration was somewhat higher (1.3 nM) than the adult monkey (0.87 nM). Significant age- dependent pharmacokinetic behaviors were observed for BPA metab- olites. The peak concentration and AUC values for BPA metabolites declined with age by nearly 2 times and 6 times, respectively, in PND 5 and adult monkeys. The predicted peak concentration and AUC values for BPA metabolites in adult humans were 50% higher and 4 times greater than in adult monkeys. At 24 h after dosing the predicted BPA dose (as BPA metabolites) remaining in the body was 1% in the monkeys, irrespective of age, and 2\u20134% of the dose (as BPA metabolites) remained in the adult humans. The model-predicted adult monkey dosimetrics, for a given dose per kg BW, is not equivalent to an adult human for the BPA metabolites. However, model-predicted peak serum free BPA levels were similar be- tween adultmonkeys and humans, with free BPA 24 h serumAUC values slightly higher (3.7\u20134.0 nM/24 h) than adult monkeys (~2.0 nM/24 h). Extrapolation of NCPPs from adult monkeys to adult humans with as- sumptions about linearity will introduce large errors for BPAmetabolites and until aglycone BPA is measured in human serum, the model predic- tions in this paper, based onmonkey BPA kinetic studies, provide the best estimates of aglycone BPA levels in humans. A controlled human intentional BPA dosing study, similar to the V\u00f6lkel et al. (2002) study, using updated analytical methods, similar to Teeguarden et al. (2011), would provide important information about the serum levels of aglycone BPA. The new human BPA kinetic study could help determine if monkeys and humans process BPA in a similar fashion and provide confidence in the utility of models devel- oped with data obtained in nonhuman primates for human risk assessment.

PBA, a well-known ER chemical chaperone, inhibits CCl4-induced hepatic ER stress and the UPR signaling. Moreover, PBA alleviates CCl4-induced hepatic NF-\u03baB translocation andMAPK signaling. In addition, PBA atten- uates CCl4-induced inflammatory response and subsequent HSC activa- tion. Importantly, PBA effectively prevents CCl4-induced hepaticfibrosis in mice (Fig. 7). Thus, chemical chaperone may have potential preven- tive and therapeutic utilities for protecting against liver fibrosis.

The possible signaling pathway for PA induced anti-inflammatory molecular mechanism. According to the data in this study, PA may affect LPS- TLR4 receptor binding, thereby down-regulating JNK/AP-1 and I\u03baB/NF-\u03baB in- flammatory signaling pathways and up-regulating antioxidant activity.

Pronounced effects on the reproductive success of the h-sitosterol females were detected in this study and for this reason, it is crucial to investigate the reproductive effects at different doses. Increased probability of repro- duction has been observed earlier in tundra voles (Microtus oeconomus) exposed to phytosterols (5 mg/kg/day; Niemi- nen et al., 2004). Thus, it would be important to examine if the increased reproductive success of the mink is dose- dependent. This effect could be harmful in nature with limited food resources, but it could be of economical use in domestic animal production. The results of this study cannot be directly applied to human risk assessment. Yet further studies are warranted, as chronic exposure to these substances causes signs of endocrine disruption in the mink. Due to the widespread use of phytoestrogens in the treatment of hyperlipidemias and postmenopausal symptoms the potential chronic effects of these compounds to human reproduction cannot be overlooked.

No other forms of antimony were genotoxic. Our conclusions were based on assuming that the generation of stibine and trimethylstibine using sodium borohydride is 100% efficient, if this is not the case then we might have underestimated the potency of these antimony compounds. The effect of arsines and stibines on the environment and on human health warrants further consideration.

Although the safety of PAF-receptor antagonists in humans is unknown, blocking jet fuel-induced immune suppression with anti-oxidants, such as Vitamins C and E, has the potential to be useful in protecting humans against jet fuel-induced immunotoxicity.

Liang et al. / Toxicology and Applied Pharmacology 326 (2017) 34\u201342 active metabolite, Manisha PatelP+ in the striatum (Giovanni et al., 1991). The levels of Manisha PatelP+ was determined in the striatum 3 h after metalloporphyrin administration to eliminate the possibility that metalloporphyrins interfere with striatal Manisha PatelTP metabolism (Liang et al., 2007). No differenceswere observed in striatalManisha PatelP+ concentrations measured 3 h after a single dose of Manisha PatelTP (15 mg/kg, s.c.) alone or 1 h after 15mg/kg, i.p. dose of AEOL 11207, 11203 or 11114 (Manisha PatelTP\u00b1 vehi- cle: 14.30\u00b1 2.74, (6);Manisha PatelTP\u00b1AEOL 11207: 14.95\u00b1 1.98, (4);Manisha PatelTP\u00b1 AEOL 11203: 14.63\u00b1 3.36, (4) andManisha PatelTP\u00b1 AEOL 11114: 14.79\u00b1 2.81, (4) \u03bcg/g tissue; values are expressed as mean + S.E.M. (N) This data suggests that the protective effects of metalloporphyrins on Manisha PatelTP neu- rotoxicity were not due to altered Manisha PatelTP metabolism and/or bioavailability. 4. Discussion In this study, we identified several metalloporphyrins (AEOL 11203, AEOL 11209, AEOL 11215, AEOL11216 andAEOL 11114)with improved pharmacodynamics profiles. This series of glyoxylatemetalloporphyrins were designed to have greater lipid solubility, oral bioavailability, and ability to cross the BBB (Trova et al., 2003). The results indicate that three of the compounds (AEOL 11203, AEOL 11216 and AEOL 11114) are BBB permeable by the i.p. route and two of them (AEOL 11203 and AEOL 11114) are orally active. The data suggest that AEOL 11203 and AEOL 11114, which are similar to AEOL 11207 (Liang et al., 2007), have relatively long plasma half-lives, rapid absorption by the gastrointestinal tract, ability to penetrate the BBB, and can achieve therapeutically active concentrations in the brain. Our phar- macokinetic data demonstrate a 33% and 30% oral bioavailability (AUCoral/AUCip%) and AUCoral of 9.46 \u03bcM/h and 3.10 \u03bcM/h in the brain for AEOL 11114 and AEOL 11203, respectively. AEOL 11114 was more effective orally than AEOL 11203 at inhibiting markers of oxidative stress and Manisha PatelTP neurotoxicity in our animal model. This is likely due to the higher oral availability and higher AUC of AEOL 11114 compared to AEOL 11203. Previous data suggest that metalloporphyrins are extremely stable and retain their metal even in the presence of EDTA (Kachadourian et al., 2004). Several of these compounds have been found to be safe and efficacious when used in both in vitro and in vivo models (Day and Crapo, 1996; Patel et al., 1996). In our study, we did not detect alter- ations in manganese levels in brain or neurobehavioral abnormality reminiscent of manganese toxicity following daily dosing of AEOL 11207, AEOL 11114, or AEOL 11203. In contrast, the manganese levels increased ~10 fold accompanied by a significant rotarod deficit in mice treated daily with an equivalent dose of MnCl2. These results indicate that the glyoxylate series of metalloporphyrins lack signs of neurotoxicity and do not result in brain manganese accumulation. AEOL 11114 and AEOL 11203 are highly lipophilic compounds and were dissolved in 5% or 1% DSMO, respectively. No significant change in body weight or behavior was found in the mice with 5% or 1% DSMO vehicle administration, which are the same volumes and doses as AEOL 11114 and AEOL 11203 injection (1 ml/kg/day x3, i.p. or p.o.), comparison with saline controls. Taken together, our data suggests that AEOL 11114 and AEOL 11203 are excellent candidates for clinical therapeutic development of neurological diseases. Manisha PatelTP is a neurotoxicant producing clinical, biochemical, and neuro- pathological changes in both human and experimental animals that are analogous to those observed in idiopathic Parkinson's disease (PD) (Beal, 2001; Przedborski and Vila, 2003). Manisha PatelTP treatment induces sig- nificant DA depletion in the striatum and DA neurons loss in the SNpc of C57BL6 mice which has been considered a well-established mouse model of PD for 30 years (Sonsalla and Heikkila, 1986; Liberatore et al., 1999; Przedborski and Vila, 2003; Liang et al., 2007). The stereolog- ical method we employed to estimate the number of TH-positive cell in SNpc as well as HPLC measurement of DA in the striatum have been shown to be reliable techniques for evaluating dopaminergic system function. This function was found to be protected by metalloporphyrin treatment in the Manisha PatelTP model. One of the major mechanisms of Manisha PatelTP neurotoxicity in vivo is thought to arise from oxidative stress due to superoxide (O2 \u2212\u2022) produc- tion from mitochondrial complex I inhibition and impaired energetics. Manisha PatelTP neurotoxicity is also thought to result in excessive nitric oxide (\u2022NO) production by microglial activation via inflammatory mecha- nisms (Przedborski and Jackson-Lewis, 1998). NO can react with O2 \u2212\u2022 to form the highly reactive nitrogen species peroxynitrite (ONOO\u2212), which causes nitration of tyrosine residues forming 3-NT in various pro- teins, including TH and \u03b1-synuclein, and results in protein dysfunction (Ara et al., 1998; Blanchard-Fillion et al., 2001). Increased 3-NT is con- sidered an important biomarker of oxidative/nitrative protein damage in Manisha PatelTP-induced Parkinsonism (Przedborski et al., 1996; Pennathur et al., 1999; Wu et al., 2002). The levels of GSH, GSSG and the ratio of this redox couple (GSH/GSSG) serve as a major intracellular indicator of redox status and oxidative stress in cells and tissues (Valko et al., 2007). A depletion of GSH levels has been observed in post-mortem samples from the SN of PD patients and in the ventral midbrain region of Manisha PatelTP-treated rodents (Perry et al., 1982; Bannon et al., 1984; Ferraro et al., 1986; Sian et al., 1994). In fact, GSH depletion is thought to play a primary pathogenic role in the etiology of PD (Jenner et al., 1992). Our results show that a Manisha PatelTP treatment decreased the GSH/ GSSG ratio and increased 3-NT formation, which correlate with the oc- currence of dopamine depletion and dopaminergic cell loss. The ability of metalloporphyrins to attenuate Manisha PatelTP-induced alterations of GSH/ GSSG ratios and 3NT correlates with their antioxidant activities and their Cmax in the brain. For example, AEOL 11203, which has a lower cat- alase activity and Cmax (~50 nM) was less effective against Manisha PatelTP-in- duced oxidative stress and DA depletion compared to AEOL 11114 which has a Cmax of ~230 nM in the brain via the oral route. Better clin- ically relevant oxidative stress biomarkers are needed to bridge pre- clinical animal study results with optimizing safe and efficacious doses in potential PD clinical trials. The data collectively suggest that orally activemetalloporphyrin cat- alytic antioxidants that readily penetrate the BBBmay be potential ther- apeutic agents for chronic neurologic diseases such as PD. Two glyoxylate metalloporphyrins catalytic antioxidants identified in this study (AEOL 11114 and AEOL 11203) and one glyoxylate metalloporphyrin catalytic antioxidant (AEOL 11207) identified in a previous study (Liang et al., 2007) may be potential candidates for fur- ther clinical development therapy for PD.

The levels of MPP+ was determined in the striatum 3 h after metalloporphyrin administration to eliminate the possibility that metalloporphyrins interfere with striatal MPTP metabolism (Liang et al., 2007). No differenceswere observed in striatalMPP+ concentrations measured 3 h after a single dose of MPTP (15 mg/kg, s.c.) alone or 1 h after 15mg/kg, i.p. dose of AEOL 11207, 11203 or 11114 (MPTP\u00b1 vehi- cle: 14.30\u00b1 2.74, (6);MPTP\u00b1AEOL 11207: 14.95\u00b1 1.98, (4);MPTP\u00b1 AEOL 11203: 14.63\u00b1 3.36, (4) andMPTP\u00b1 AEOL 11114: 14.79\u00b1 2.81, (4) \u03bcg/g tissue; values are expressed as mean + S.E.M. (N) This data suggests that the protective effects of metalloporphyrins on MPTP neu- rotoxicity were not due to altered MPTP metabolism and/or bioavailability. 4. Discussion In this study, we identified several metalloporphyrins (AEOL 11203, AEOL 11209, AEOL 11215, AEOL11216 andAEOL 11114)with improved pharmacodynamics profiles. This series of glyoxylatemetalloporphyrins were designed to have greater lipid solubility, oral bioavailability, and ability to cross the BBB (Trova et al., 2003). The results indicate that three of the compounds (AEOL 11203, AEOL 11216 and AEOL 11114) are BBB permeable by the i.p. route and two of them (AEOL 11203 and AEOL 11114) are orally active. The data suggest that AEOL 11203 and AEOL 11114, which are similar to AEOL 11207 (Liang et al., 2007), have relatively long plasma half-lives, rapid absorption by the gastrointestinal tract, ability to penetrate the BBB, and can achieve therapeutically active concentrations in the brain. Our phar- macokinetic data demonstrate a 33% and 30% oral bioavailability (AUCoral/AUCip%) and AUCoral of 9.46 \u03bcM/h and 3.10 \u03bcM/h in the brain for AEOL 11114 and AEOL 11203, respectively. AEOL 11114 was more effective orally than AEOL 11203 at inhibiting markers of oxidative stress and MPTP neurotoxicity in our animal model. This is likely due to the higher oral availability and higher AUC of AEOL 11114 compared to AEOL 11203. Previous data suggest that metalloporphyrins are extremely stable and retain their metal even in the presence of EDTA (Kachadourian et al., 2004). Several of these compounds have been found to be safe and efficacious when used in both in vitro and in vivo models (Day and Crapo, 1996; Patel et al., 1996). In our study, we did not detect alter- ations in manganese levels in brain or neurobehavioral abnormality reminiscent of manganese toxicity following daily dosing of AEOL 11207, AEOL 11114, or AEOL 11203. In contrast, the manganese levels increased ~10 fold accompanied by a significant rotarod deficit in mice treated daily with an equivalent dose of MnCl2. These results indicate that the glyoxylate series of metalloporphyrins lack signs of neurotoxicity and do not result in brain manganese accumulation. AEOL 11114 and AEOL 11203 are highly lipophilic compounds and were dissolved in 5% or 1% DSMO, respectively. No significant change in body weight or behavior was found in the mice with 5% or 1% DSMO vehicle administration, which are the same volumes and doses as AEOL 11114 and AEOL 11203 injection (1 ml/kg/day x3, i.p. or p.o.), comparison with saline controls. Taken together, our data suggests that AEOL 11114 and AEOL 11203 are excellent candidates for clinical therapeutic development of neurological diseases. MPTP is a neurotoxicant producing clinical, biochemical, and neuro- pathological changes in both human and experimental animals that are analogous to those observed in idiopathic Parkinson's disease (PD) (Beal, 2001; Przedborski and Vila, 2003). MPTP treatment induces sig- nificant DA depletion in the striatum and DA neurons loss in the SNpc of C57BL6 mice which has been considered a well-established mouse model of PD for 30 years (Sonsalla and Heikkila, 1986; Liberatore et al., 1999; Przedborski and Vila, 2003; Liang et al., 2007). The stereolog- ical method we employed to estimate the number of TH-positive cell in SNpc as well as HPLC measurement of DA in the striatum have been shown to be reliable techniques for evaluating dopaminergic system function. This function was found to be protected by metalloporphyrin treatment in the MPTP model. One of the major mechanisms of MPTP neurotoxicity in vivo is thought to arise from oxidative stress due to superoxide (O2 \u2212\u2022) produc- tion from mitochondrial complex I inhibition and impaired energetics. MPTP neurotoxicity is also thought to result in excessive nitric oxide (\u2022NO) production by microglial activation via inflammatory mecha- nisms (Przedborski and Jackson-Lewis, 1998). NO can react with O2 \u2212\u2022 to form the highly reactive nitrogen species peroxynitrite (ONOO\u2212), which causes nitration of tyrosine residues forming 3-NT in various pro- teins, including TH and \u03b1-synuclein, and results in protein dysfunction (Ara et al., 1998; Blanchard-Fillion et al., 2001). Increased 3-NT is con- sidered an important biomarker of oxidative/nitrative protein damage in MPTP-induced Parkinsonism (Przedborski et al., 1996; Pennathur et al., 1999; Wu et al., 2002). The levels of GSH, GSSG and the ratio of this redox couple (GSH/GSSG) serve as a major intracellular indicator of redox status and oxidative stress in cells and tissues (Valko et al., 2007). A depletion of GSH levels has been observed in post-mortem samples from the SN of PD patients and in the ventral midbrain region of MPTP-treated rodents (Perry et al., 1982; Bannon et al., 1984; Ferraro et al., 1986; Sian et al., 1994). In fact, GSH depletion is thought to play a primary pathogenic role in the etiology of PD (Jenner et al., 1992). Our results show that a MPTP treatment decreased the GSH/ GSSG ratio and increased 3-NT formation, which correlate with the oc- currence of dopamine depletion and dopaminergic cell loss. The ability of metalloporphyrins to attenuate MPTP-induced alterations of GSH/ GSSG ratios and 3NT correlates with their antioxidant activities and their Cmax in the brain. For example, AEOL 11203, which has a lower cat- alase activity and Cmax (~50 nM) was less effective against MPTP-in- duced oxidative stress and DA depletion compared to AEOL 11114 which has a Cmax of ~230 nM in the brain via the oral route. Better clin- ically relevant oxidative stress biomarkers are needed to bridge pre- clinical animal study results with optimizing safe and efficacious doses in potential PD clinical trials. The data collectively suggest that orally activemetalloporphyrin cat- alytic antioxidants that readily penetrate the BBBmay be potential ther- apeutic agents for chronic neurologic diseases such as PD. Two glyoxylate metalloporphyrins catalytic antioxidants identified in this study (AEOL 11114 and AEOL 11203) and one glyoxylate metalloporphyrin catalytic antioxidant (AEOL 11207) identified in a previous study (Liang et al., 2007) may be potential candidates for fur- ther clinical development therapy for PD.

The mechanisms underlying this nephroprotective effect could be partially through counteracting cisplatin-induced oxidative stress indicated by significant increase in GSH and SOD aswell decrease in lipid peroxidation. Also, cardamonin has shown a powerful anti- inflammatory activity manifested by reducing pro-inflammatory markers; IL-1\u03b2, TNF-\u03b1, NF-kB, iNOS, ICAM-1 and MCP-1. In addition, cardamonin attenuated cisplatin-induced increase in NOX-1 expres- sion, which was found to play a role in cisplatin-induced renal injury.

D: Cytotoxicity of various concentrations of cisplatin alone cally significantwhen compared to the control value using ANOVA followedbyDunnett test as p treated with cisplatin alone using unpaired t-test. Moreover, cardamonin significantly reduced cell death by decreasing caspases-3 activity and Bax/Bcl-2 ratio as well as by increasing the survival factor, EGF. Interestingly, cisplatin cytotoxic activity was signif- icantly enhanced by pre-treatment with subtoxic concentration of cardamonin for 24 h in four different human cancer cell lines; hela, hepG2, PC3 andHCT116 cancer cell lines. Taken together, these findings suggest that cardamonin improves therapeutic index of cisplatin.

Here, we propose the hypothesis (Fig. 7) that, prenatal caffeine ingestion induces the fetal over-exposure to maternal GC, which may cause the epigenetic alteration of HPA axis functional development-related genes and the GC-dependent changes of blood glucose and lipid metabolic phenotypes in utero (Xu et al., 2012b). This neuroendocrine metabolic programming alteration by caffeine (showing lower basic activity but enhanced stress sensitivity of HPA axis as well as the corresponding alterations of blood glucose and lipid phenotypes) could extend until after birth in F1 (Xu et al., 2012a) and also appeared in F2 rats. This study will be beneficial for elucidating the susceptibility to metabolic syndrome and associated diseases in F2.

One study in adults exposed to lead without noise exposure (>85 dB), showed an increased hearing threshold at high frequencies (>3 kHz), as well as further peripheral and central auditory dysfunction (Castellanos and Fuente, 2016). Another study in children exposed to lead due to elec- tronic waste (e-waste) showed an increased hearing threshold at low frequencies (<2 kHz), even though the children showed low BPb levels (<5 \u03bcg/dL) (Liu et al., 2018). These results support that safe limit for lead should be discuss in order to prevent hearing impairment, Hem- mativaghef, 2020 based on significative association studies conclude that a BPb >2 \u03bcg/dL is the Lowest Observed Adverse Effect Level (LOAEL) for hearing damage. In our study participants were asked about occupational and leisure noise activities. We observed in audiograms that participants showed a notch related with noise exposure. Actually, noise exposure is a public health problem. Global Burden of Disease 2010 estimated that 1\u22c53 billion people are affected by hearing loss and investigators rated hearing loss as the 13th most important contributor (19\u22c59 million years, 2\u22c56% of total number) to the global years lived with disability (YLD) (Vos and Flxman, 2012). Hearing impairment due to noise exposure could affect by a one-time exposure to an intense impulse sound, or by steady state long-term exposure. Thus, the results that we observed in our participants could be related to noise and lead exposure through life history. The characteristic pathological feature of noise-induced hearing loss is the loss of auditory sensory cells in the cochlea. Because these hair cells cannot regenerate in mammals, no remission can occur; prevention of noise-induced hearing loss is the only option to preserve hearing (Basner et al., 2014). At the molecular level lead is a mimetic for calcium in different cells and tissues (Marchetti, 2013). In the inner ear, the otoconia are the main calcium deposits for the auditory system. Otolin-1 protein plays an important role in storing calcium ions at the basilar and tectorial membranes in the cochlea (Yang et al., 2011). New evidence suggests that the outer hair cells response decreases when calcium stores are altered by exposure noise or calcium chelators (Strimbu et al., 2019). At the time there is no evidence that otolin-1 is affected by noise or calcium chelator exposures. Even though we observed a nonsignificant trend of a decrease in otolin-1 levels by BPb and increased hearing threshold, more studies are needed to evaluate whether otolin-1 levels could be affected by lead exposure. The motor protein prestin increases the length of the outer hair cells to improve sound discrimination and hearing response acting incochlear amplification. Bioinformatic studies suggest that prestin is functionally regulated by calcium/calmodulin (CaM) binding sites, and the CaM- prestin interaction may be involved in the modulation of cochlear amplification (Keller et al., 2014). Hearing loss is a multifactorial and age-specific disease, and lifestyle habits, health status, ototoxicity and noise exposure are important risk factors (Aghazadeh-Attari et al., 2017). The participants in the present study showed a chronic exposure to lead due to work or LGC habits over years, as we showed in multiple regression analysis. We observed that women over 39 years old without MSR and low BPb levels showed the highest serum prestin concentration. Some studies suggest that hearing function in women after menopause is diminished due to the decrease in estrogen levels (Hederstierna et al., 2007). One study evaluated prestin expression in ovariectomized rats and reported a decrease in the amount of prestin RNA, which correlated with an increase in hearing threshold (Diao et al., 2019). In addition to the evidence that the lack of estrogens is related to hearing loss, the presence of MSR plays an important role in hearing capacity as it modifies the composition of the inner ear membrane system (Aghaza- deh-Attari et al., 2017). Similarly, there is evidence that chronic expo- sure to lead can increase the MSR (Planchart et al., 2018). Our study has some limitations that should be considered. The cross- sectional design does not allow us to establish causation for our results. Patella X-ray measurement is the main biomarker for chronic exposure to lead. In our study, we used the BPb as a biomarker because it is a more accessible measure. As we could not measure noise exposure for each participant, we asked them about noise exposure habits, as shown in Table 2. For further studies related to hearing biomarkers and ototox- icity, noise exposure should be measured individually considered as an important control variable. 5. Conclusion This is the first study to evaluate prestin as a potential biomarker for hearing loss due to lead exposure. We concluded that the serum protein prestin concentration decreases according to hearing threshold related to lead exposure. We observed that lead exposure plays an important role in hearing threshold aside environmental noise exposure, in future studies should be considered as an important variable. The molecular bases of hearing impairment, such as overexposure to ototoxic agents, are similarly poorly understood and an area of active research.

These results support that safe limit for lead should be discuss in order to prevent hearing impairment, Hem- mativaghef, 2020 based on significative association studies conclude that a BPb >2 \u03bcg/dL is the Lowest Observed Adverse Effect Level (LOAEL) for hearing damage. In our study participants were asked about occupational and leisure noise activities. We observed in audiograms that participants showed a notch related with noise exposure. Actually, noise exposure is a public health problem. Global Burden of Disease 2010 estimated that 1\u22c53 billion people are affected by hearing loss and investigators rated hearing loss as the 13th most important contributor (19\u22c59 million years, 2\u22c56% of total number) to the global years lived with disability (YLD) (Vos and Flxman, 2012). Hearing impairment due to noise exposure could affect by a one-time exposure to an intense impulse sound, or by steady state long-term exposure. Thus, the results that we observed in our participants could be related to noise and lead exposure through life history. The characteristic pathological feature of noise-induced hearing loss is the loss of auditory sensory cells in the cochlea. Because these hair cells cannot regenerate in mammals, no remission can occur; prevention of noise-induced hearing loss is the only option to preserve hearing (Basner et al., 2014). At the molecular level lead is a mimetic for calcium in different cells and tissues (Marchetti, 2013). In the inner ear, the otoconia are the main calcium deposits for the auditory system. Otolin-1 protein plays an important role in storing calcium ions at the basilar and tectorial membranes in the cochlea (Yang et al., 2011). New evidence suggests that the outer hair cells response decreases when calcium stores are altered by exposure noise or calcium chelators (Strimbu et al., 2019). At the time there is no evidence that otolin-1 is affected by noise or calcium chelator exposures. Even though we observed a nonsignificant trend of a decrease in otolin-1 levels by BPb and increased hearing threshold, more studies are needed to evaluate whether otolin-1 levels could be affected by lead exposure. The motor protein prestin increases the length of the outer hair cells to improve sound discrimination and hearing response acting incochlear amplification. Bioinformatic studies suggest that prestin is functionally regulated by calcium/calmodulin (CaM) binding sites, and the CaM- prestin interaction may be involved in the modulation of cochlear amplification (Keller et al., 2014). Hearing loss is a multifactorial and age-specific disease, and lifestyle habits, health status, ototoxicity and noise exposure are important risk factors (Aghazadeh-Attari et al., 2017). The participants in the present study showed a chronic exposure to lead due to work or LGC habits over years, as we showed in multiple regression analysis. We observed that women over 39 years old without MSR and low BPb levels showed the highest serum prestin concentration. Some studies suggest that hearing function in women after menopause is diminished due to the decrease in estrogen levels (Hederstierna et al., 2007). One study evaluated prestin expression in ovariectomized rats and reported a decrease in the amount of prestin RNA, which correlated with an increase in hearing threshold (Diao et al., 2019). In addition to the evidence that the lack of estrogens is related to hearing loss, the presence of MSR plays an important role in hearing capacity as it modifies the composition of the inner ear membrane system (Aghaza- deh-Attari et al., 2017). Similarly, there is evidence that chronic expo- sure to lead can increase the MSR (Planchart et al., 2018). Our study has some limitations that should be considered. The cross- sectional design does not allow us to establish causation for our results. Patella X-ray measurement is the main biomarker for chronic exposure to lead. In our study, we used the BPb as a biomarker because it is a more accessible measure. As we could not measure noise exposure for each participant, we asked them about noise exposure habits, as shown in Table 2. For further studies related to hearing biomarkers and ototox- icity, noise exposure should be measured individually considered as an important control variable. 5. Conclusion This is the first study to evaluate prestin as a potential biomarker for hearing loss due to lead exposure. We concluded that the serum protein prestin concentration decreases according to hearing threshold related to lead exposure. We observed that lead exposure plays an important role in hearing threshold aside environmental noise exposure, in future studies should be considered as an important variable. The molecular bases of hearing impairment, such as overexposure to ototoxic agents, are similarly poorly understood and an area of active research.

One study in adults exposed to lead without noise exposure (>85 dB), showed an increased hearing threshold at high frequencies (>3 kHz), as well as further peripheral and central auditory dysfunction (Castellanos and Fuente, 2016). Another study in children exposed to lead due to elec- tronic waste (e-waste) showed an increased hearing threshold at low frequencies (<2 kHz), even though the children showed low BPb levels (<5 \u03bcg/dL) (Liu et al., 2018). These results support that safe limit for lead should be discuss in order to prevent hearing impairment, Hem- mativaghef, 2020 based on significative association studies conclude that a BPb >2 \u03bcg/dL is the Lowest Observed Adverse Effect Level (LOAEL) for hearing damage. In our study participants were asked about occupational and leisure noise activities. We observed in audiograms that participants showed a notch related with noise exposure. Actually, noise exposure is a public health problem. Global Burden of Disease 2010 estimated that 1\u22c53 billion people are affected by hearing loss and investigators rated hearing loss as the 13th most important contributor (19\u22c59 million years, 2\u22c56% of total number) to the global years lived with disability (YLD) (Vos and Flxman, 2012). Hearing impairment due to noise exposure could affect by a one-time exposure to an intense impulse sound, or by steady state long-term exposure. Thus, the results that we observed in our participants could be related to noise and lead exposure through life history. The characteristic pathological feature of noise-induced hearing loss is the loss of auditory sensory cells in the cochlea. Because these hair cells cannot regenerate in mammals, no remission can occur; prevention of noise-induced hearing loss is the only option to preserve hearing (Basner et al., 2014). At the molecular level lead is a mimetic for calcium in different cells and tissues (Marchetti, 2013). In the inner ear, the otoconia are the main calcium deposits for the auditory system. Otolin-1 protein plays an important role in storing calcium ions at the basilar and tectorial membranes in the cochlea (Yang et al., 2011). New evidence suggests that the outer hair cells response decreases when calcium stores are altered by exposure noise or calcium chelators (Strimbu et al., 2019). At the time there is no evidence that otolin-1 is affected by noise or calcium chelator exposures. Even though we observed a nonsignificant trend of a decrease in otolin-1 levels by BPb and increased hearing threshold, more studies are needed to evaluate whether otolin-1 levels could be affected by lead exposure. The motor protein prestin increases the length of the outer hair cells to improve sound discrimination and hearing response acting incochlear amplification. Bioinformatic studies suggest that prestin is functionally regulated by calcium/calmodulin (CaM) binding sites, and the CaM- prestin interaction may be involved in the modulation of cochlear amplification (Keller et al., 2014). Hearing loss is a multifactorial and age-specific disease, and lifestyle habits, health status, ototoxicity and noise exposure are important risk factors (Aghazadeh-Attari et al., 2017). The participants in the present study showed a chronic exposure to lead due to work or LGC habits over years, as we showed in multiple regression analysis. We observed that women over 39 years old without MSR and low BPb levels showed the highest serum prestin concentration. Some studies suggest that hearing function in women after menopause is diminished due to the decrease in estrogen levels (Hederstierna et al., 2007). One study evaluated prestin expression in ovariectomized rats and reported a decrease in the amount of prestin RNA, which correlated with an increase in hearing threshold (Diao et al., 2019). In addition to the evidence that the lack of estrogens is related to hearing loss, the presence of MSR plays an important role in hearing capacity as it modifies the composition of the inner ear membrane system (Aghaza- deh-Attari et al., 2017). Similarly, there is evidence that chronic expo- sure to lead can increase the MSR (Planchart et al., 2018). Our study has some limitations that should be considered. The cross- sectional design does not allow us to establish causation for our results. Patella X-ray measurement is the main biomarker for chronic exposure to lead. In our study, we used the BPb as a biomarker because it is a more accessible measure. As we could not measure noise exposure for each participant, we asked them about noise exposure habits, as shown in Table 2. For further studies related to hearing biomarkers and ototox- icity, noise exposure should be measured individually considered as an important control variable. 5. Conclusion This is the first study to evaluate prestin as a potential biomarker for hearing loss due to lead exposure. We concluded that the serum protein prestin concentration decreases according to hearing threshold related to lead exposure. We observed that lead exposure plays an important role in hearing threshold aside environmental noise exposure, in future studies should be considered as an important variable. The molecular bases of hearing impairment, such as overexposure to ototoxic agents, are similarly poorly understood and an area of active research.

Apoptosis was found to account for only a small portion of cell loss and themajority of neuronal death is probably due to necrosis associated with severe astrocytosis.

An early phase lasting about 5 min is dominated by cholinergic overactivity followed by a transitional phase of cholinergic and glutamatergic hyperactivity and finally a predominantly glutamatergic phase after about 40 min (McDonough and Shih, 1997). The results obtained in the present study seem to be in compliance with these phases. Seizure activity emerging as a result of insufficient prophylactic treatment was successfully terminated by scopolamine (1 mg/kg) 3 min after onset. Scopolamine injected 10 min following onset of seizures did not result in termination. Furthermore, additional adjunct therapy consisting of diazepam and pentobarbital terminated the seizures when administered 15\u201320 min following onset. The latter finding is consistent", "Acknowledgement": "T.

In conclusion, we report here that the dichlorvos induced nigrostriatal neuronal death produces the characteristic alterations in the behavioral pattern, which is further corroborated by the biochemical alterations in the various classical parameters. Furthermore, pre- treating rats with CoQ10 before dichlorvos exposure leads to a restoration of behavioral impairments and nigrostriatal integrity by reversing the effect and restoring near normal levels of mitochondrial ETC activity, TH expression, and of DA levels. Therefore, low level chronic CoQ10 pretreatment appears to act as an antioxidant and hence scavenges free radicals, enhances mitochondrial functions as well as protects dopaminergic neurons and thus rescues the compromised cells and reverses dopaminergic lesions and behavioral impairments. Further studies to understand the dose responses effects of CoQ10 and sequence of events would be worth investigating.

Additionally, our previous stud- ies clearly suggested that sanguinarine inhibited the activation of MAPK, which altered inflammatory mediator synthesis and release in vitro (Niu et al., 2012). In conclusion, the results of the present report demonstrate that SANG pre-treatment exerts beneficial effects in a mice model of colitis induced by the acetic acid. We observed that SANG administration significantly decreased colonic damage, colonic MPO activity and expression of pro-inflammatory mediators IL-6 and TNF-\u03b1. These protective effects were associated with a reduced level of p65 NF-\u03baB subunit in the nucleus. Thus, we propose that the anti-inflammatory activity of SANG may be mediated, at least in part, by inhibition of the expression of certain pro-inflammatory mediators, which are regulated by the NF-\u03baB signalling pathway. Our data support previous research suggesting that NF-\u03baB may be a new and effective therapy target in IBD patients. Human studies would be beneficial in elucidating the effects of SANG more clearly. Conflict of interest statement The authors have declared that there is no conflict of interest.

It could be used as a potential antidote to treat the POD intoxication in clinical practice. Conflict of interest There are no conflict of interest in this paper. Fig. 11.

Protein matching will be an efficient method to evaluate the possibility of whetherMWCNTs cause disease, if the protein database related to all diseases is established, like the gene database related to genomic disease. To contribute to the protein database, we are gathering data regarding the changes in protein expression caused by exposing cells to various compounds. At the same time, we are verifying the biological response using a proteomics approach in vivo. These data will allow us to assess safety issues regarding CNTs and other nanomaterials in a more accurate way. In addition, the proteomics-based approach is likely to detect impurities, secondary influence, and response mechanism.

This is most likely due to the low intrinsic toxicity of emulsion PVC particles, even when they contain residual additives. An unexpected and as yet unex- plained finding was that the washed PVC particles caused an influx of eosinophils in the lungs. These findings show how difficult it is to extrapolate in vitro observations to the in vivo situation. Nevertheless, the pulmonary changes caused by a single intratracheal instillation of PVC particles were limited and reversible, unlike those found after silica particles.

We were able to mine rat toxicogenomics data and confirm the usefulness as selected biomarkers in a non-rodent species. Based on our results, clusterin, HAVcr-1, and OPN gene expression changes are proposed as candidate predictive biomarkers of drug-in- duced nephrotoxicity in cynomolgus monkeys. Further- more, the use of a logistic regression model enabled us to rank candidate genomic biomarkers and compare them with accepted clinical biomarkers. Due to the limited number of drugs tested in our study and small number of test subjects, additional work is necessary to confirm and extend our observations.

Mitochondrial dysfunction was also observed (lower basal and maximum respiration, and reduced ATP production), which is hypothe- sized to contribute to the developmental toxicity. In addition, lower ATP production and altered mstna and myoD expression is proposed to un- derlie, in part, the decrease in locomotor performance in larvae.

AC induced changes in most of the major protein handling systems examined including proteasomal activity, the ER stress response, autophagy and formation of aggresome-like inclusion bodies. Both BQ and AC induced proteasomal inhibition that was closely associated temporally with induction of the ER stress response and autophagy. The effect of NQO1 on modulating protein handling changes and toxicity was also quinone-specific.While two-electron reduction of BQ protected against toxicity, the unstable hydroquinones generated from AC and MD underwent rapid autoxidation to produce ROS leading to an activated ER stress response and increased toxicity.

Acute intoxication resulted in pronounced impairments of mitochondrial respiratory parameters. Despite numerous biochemical and morphologi- cal signs of intoxication after 30 days of toxic agent administration, an ad- aptation of mitochondrial respiratory parameters was observed. Long- termmelatonin administration preventedmarkedlymitochondrialmem- brane damage and enhanced regenerative processes in the liver. The hepatoprotective effect of melatonin is due to antioxidant, membrane- stabilizing and anti-inflammatory properties. The synergistic action of melatonin, succinate and plant polyphenols may be useful for clinical application. Conflict of interest statement The authors declare that there is no conflict of interest.

Accordingly, apoptosis induced by 400 mM FOA is more efficiently blocked by CsA than by NAC. The lack of complete inhibition of 400 mM PFOA-induced poptosis by either NAC or CsA might be due to the fact that FOA, as many other peroxisome proliferators, has strong ipophilicity i.e., ability to interact directly with lipids. Such an nteraction will alter the membrane architecture and lipid pack- ng, thereby providing a direct, physical, membrane altering echanism for perfluorinated fatty acid toxicity leading to ecrosis (Levitt et al., 1987). However, as we have shown reviously, treatment of HepG2 cells with PFOA concentra- ions up to 450 mM induces biochemical changes (DNA frag- is (Shabalina et al., 1999) and not necrosis. It is tempting to speculate that both accumulation of ROS nd disruption of DCm, could result in a self-amplifying loop, in which disruption of the mitochondrial compartments favors the accumulation of radicals and radical-mediated damage, as well as the breakdown of respiratory metabolism. Together, these events participate in the execution of the apoptotic path- way. In summary, we have shown evidence that PFOA exerts its cytotoxic effect through hypergeneration of ROS and mito- chondrial depolarization. This results in the activation of caspase-9, which in turn activates the apoptotic pathway. The addition of either a potent antioxidant or an MPT inhibitor reverses this apoptotic effect as shown by DNA histograms and lack of caspase-9 activation.

In BEAS-2B cells, we had also noticed S21 phosphorylation of the EZH2 protein through the activation of the JNK-STAT3-Akt signaling axis in response to As3+ (Chen et al., 2013). The present report further unraveled the im- portance of oxidative stress or ROS in this As3+-induced EZH2 phos- phorylation, which confirmed our previous findings showing that As3+ is able to induce ROS generation in the non-transformed BEAS- 2B cells (Chang et al., 2010). Given the critical roles of ROS and EZH2 in human cancers related to environmental exposure, the data from this report may shed new light on the prevention or treatment of human lung cancer or other cancers resulting from environmental ex- posure to As3+ or other carcinogens.

Acknowledgment Discussion Funding sources Conflict of interest Acknowledgment References", "Funding": "In conclusion, the present findings show that both Nox activation and mitochondrial respiration are involved in the altered lung O2 me- tabolism observed after ROFA inhalation. Nox activation seems to be a relevant non-mitochondrial source of reactive oxygen species in this model. The exposure to ROFA also impacts on mitochondrial function, leading to an increased electron transport rate (evidenced by the higher state 3 respiration), mitochondrial membrane depolarization, decreased ATP production rate and, consequently, deficient oxidative phosphorylation. This situation, known as mild mitochondrial uncoupling, may prevent the mitochondrial generation of reactive O2 species, which, in turn, could cause oxidative damage within the organelle. The results shown in this work provide new insights in the molecular mechanisms involved in lung injury by O2 metab- olism alterations triggered by PM inhalation.

IGF-I expression in leiomyoma cells was down-regulated by SB, indicating that SB may participate in inhibition of leio- myoma growth. Data indicate that reduction of proliferation in SB-treated is associated with decreased amounts of IGF-I mRNA and protein. From the raw materials, the five compounds were isolated and the chemical structures of resveratrol, baicalin, berberine, apigenin, and luteolin were determined. Of them, two flavonoids of apigenin and luteolin were inhibitory for the growth of LM cells, suggesting that flavonoids of apigenin and luteolin are potentially useful for the development of therapeutic treat- ments of cancer. These observations suggest a role for SB in growth inhibition of leiomyomal cells. Taken together, the present study suggests that SB inhibited leiomyomal cell growth mediated by IGF-I in human uterus.

Male Sprague\u2013Dawley rats weighing 225\u2013250 g were obtained from Harlan, Indianapolis, IN. Animals were housed in wire-bottom cages at a 12/12 h light/dark cycle, 22 \u00b0C ambient temperature, and a relative humidity of 40\u201360%. All rats had ad libitum access to water and 8604RodentDiet supplied byHarlanTeklad,Madison,WI. The research presentedwas conducted in compliancewithNIHGuidance for theCare andUse of Animals and was approved by the KUMC Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. Preparation of cytosolic protein and the binding assay were performed as described elsewhere (Bradfield et al., 1988; Bradfield and Poland, 1988). In brief, rats received a lethal injection of pentobarbital and livers were perfused with cold 150mMKCl(aq), adjusted to pH7.4. The tissue was homogenized inMDENG buffer containing 25 mM 3-(N-morpholino)-propane sulfonic acid, 0.02% sodium azide, 1 mM ethylenediaminotetraacetate, 10% (w/v) glycerol, and 1 mM dithiothreitol and adjusted to pH 7.5. A 12,000\u00d7g supernatant was prepared by centrifugation at 4 \u00b0C for 20 min. Ultracentrifugation (440,000\u00d7g for 25 min) Fig. 3. Competitive displacement of 3H-TCDD from its specific binding site on the AhR by increasing concentrations of TCDD, Me-TCPT, and its sulfoxides. yielded hepatic cytosol, containing the AhR in the supernatant. Aliquots were stored at \u221280 \u00b0C until use. Protein content was determined using the Better Bradford assay by Pierce Biotechnology, Inc., Rockford, IL, and cytosol was diluted with buffer to 5 mg/ml protein for assaying. The solvent for all compounds was dimethylsulfoxide. Four experiments were run in triplicate, each using 200 \u03bcl cytosol, in order to measure: \u2022 Total binding of TCDD: cytosol+1 \u03bcl of 200 nM 3H-TCDD. \u2022 Non-specific binding of TCDD: a) + 1 \u03bcl of 20 \u03bcM 3,3\u2032,4,4\u2032-"}},

First, rats and mice may be more predisposed to nasal lesions than humans because they are obligatory nasal breathers. Second, a larger portion of the rodent nasal cavity is lined by olfactory mucosa (50%) relative to humans (10%). Third, the olfactory mucosa in the caudal region of the rat and mouse nose lines a complex network of ethmoid turbinates that greatly expands the surface area available for chemical uptake and slows the speed of air flow, enhancing the deposition efficiency of inhaled toxicants (Proctor and Changm, 1983). These fac- tors increase the likelihood that an inhaled chemical in the rodent nose will reach the olfactory mucosa at a local concentration sufficient to cause toxicity and, with time, a histologic lesion. Additional research will be required to determine the significance of the rat and mouse olfactory lesion to an assessment of risk to human health from subchronic exposure to relatively low levels of H2S.

There was no \u201cease\u201d or \u201ccasualness\u201d in our examination of the evidence for DCM and the analyses we did. We are pointing out that the two-pathway model is based on the assumption that CYP2E1 has only one active site with very tight affinity. However, CYP2E1 is versatile in that it can metabolize both very small and very large molecules. We note current literature that describes hinges within the molecule that can open alternate pathways that accommodate the largermolecules. This is the same concept that we are applying to DCM as an alternate hypothesis. We advocate an examination of the data and acknowledgement of the uncertainties regarding the specificity of support of DCM data for the existing hypothesis. We encourage further examination and develop- ment of data for DCM MOA implications and assumptions regarding the dilution of human risk from exposure to this chemical. Rather than supporting a policy-driven approach, we are advocating a science- based approach. Such an approach includes acknowledging the uncertainties and discrepancies between the data and the existing two-pathway hypothesis, the non-specificity of the experimental data to distinguish between two-site and two-pathway PBPK modeling of DCM metabolism in vivo, and the need for further examination of the two-site hypothesis as a MOA of DCM-induced effects. Comment 8: We disagree with Anders et al. that our work is not of high quality. The present work meticulously uses the same models, approaches, and data as prior work by the Anders et al. to which we"}},
